disease,cause
diabetes,"Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes
Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.

Genes may play a role in some people. It’s also possible that a virus sets off an immune system attack.

Type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Having overweight or obesity increases your risk, too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar.

This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.

Type 1.5 diabetes
Type 1.5 is an autoimmune condition that occurs when the pancreas is attacked by your own antibodies. as in type 1. It may be genetic, but more research is needed.

Gestational diabetes
Gestational diabetes occurs as the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant person’s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy.

People who are overweight when they get pregnant or who gain too much weight during pregnancy are more likely to get gestational diabetes."
pneumonia,"Pneumonia happens when germs get into your lungs and cause an infection. The immune system’s reaction to clear the infection results in inflammation of the lung’s air sacs (alveoli). This inflammation can eventually cause the air sacs to fill up with pus and liquids, causing pneumonia symptoms.

Several types of infectious agents can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

Bacterial pneumonia
The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other causes include:

Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Haemophilus influenzae
Legionella pneumophila

Viral pneumonia
Respiratory viruses are often the cause of pneumonia. Examples of viral infections that can cause pneumonia include:

influenza (flu)
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
rhinoviruses (common cold)
human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection
human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection
measles
chickenpox (varicella-zoster virus)
adenovirus infection
coronavirus infection
SARS-CoV-2 infection (the virus that causes COVID-19)

Although the symptoms of viral and bacterial pneumonia are very similar, viral pneumonia is usually milder. It can improve in 1 to 3 weeks without treatment.

According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood InstituteTrusted Source, people with viral pneumonia are at risk of developing bacterial pneumonia.

Fungal pneumonia
Fungi from soil or bird droppings can cause pneumonia. They most often cause pneumonia in people with weakened immune systems. Examples of fungi that can cause pneumonia include:

Pneumocystis jirovecii
Cryptococcus species
Histoplasmosis species
Coccidioides species"
asthma,"Although asthma is especially common in children, many people don’t develop asthma until adulthood.

Health experts have not identified a specific cause of asthma. Instead, researchers believe it’s caused by a variety of factors, including:

-Genetics: If your parent or sibling has asthma, you’re more likely to develop it.
-History of viral infections: People with a history of severe viral infections during childhood, such as respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV), may be more likely to develop asthma.
-Hygiene hypothesis: When babies are not exposed to enough bacteria in their early months and years, their immune systems may not become strong enough to fight off asthma and other allergic conditions.

Many factors can also trigger asthma, causing the symptoms to worsen. Triggers for asthma can vary, and some people may be more sensitive to certain triggers than others.

The most common triggers include:

health conditions such as respiratory infections
exercise
environmental irritants
allergens
intense emotions
extreme weather conditions
pests
certain medications, including aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)"
gout,"The buildup of uric acid in your blood from the breakdown of purines causes gout.

Certain conditions, such as blood and metabolism disorders or dehydration, make your body produce too much uric acid.

A kidney or thyroid problem, or an inherited disorder, can make it harder for your body to remove excess uric acid.

You’re more likely to get gout if you:

are a middle-aged man or postmenopausal woman
have parents, siblings, or other family members with gout
drink alcohol
take medications such as diuretics and cyclosporine
have a condition like high blood pressure, kidney disease, thyroid disease, diabetes, or sleep apnea
For some people, gout is caused by consuming foods that are high in gout-producing purines."
malaria,"Malaria can occur if a mosquito infected with the Plasmodium parasite bites you. There are four kinds of malaria parasites that can infect humans: Plasmodium vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. falciparum.

P. falciparum causes a more severe form of the disease and those who contract this form of malaria have a higher risk of death. An infected mother can also pass the disease to her baby at birth. This is known as congenital malaria.

Malaria is transmitted by blood, so it can also be transmitted through:

an organ transplant
a transfusion
use of shared needles or syringes"
migraine,"Researchers haven’t identified a definitive cause for migraine. But experts believe a combination of genetics, hormones, and irregular brain activity all play a role. These factors likely contribute to affecting nerve signaling, chemicals, and blood vessels in the brain.

What can trigger a migraine attack?
More than three-quarters of people with migraine report that something triggers their migraine attacks. These could be things in their diet, changes in their environment, or other events.

While migraine triggers can be very personal, commonly reported triggers include:

bright lights
severe heat, or other extremes in weather
dehydration
changes in barometric pressure
hormone changes in people assigned female at birth, like estrogen and progesterone fluctuations during menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause
excess stress
loud sounds
intense physical activity
skipping meals
changes in sleep patterns
use of certain medications, like oral contraceptives or nitroglycerin
unusual smells
certain foods
smoking
alcohol use
traveling

If you experience a migraine attack, a doctor may ask you to keep a headache journal. Writing down what you were doing, what foods you ate, and what medications you took before your migraine attack began can help identify your triggers."
appendicitis,"In many cases, the exact cause of appendicitis is unknown. Experts believe it develops when part of the appendix becomes obstructed or blocked.

Many things can potentially blockTrusted Source your appendix, including:

a buildup of hardened stool
enlarged lymphoid follicles
intestinal worms
traumatic injury
tumors"
diarrhea,"You may experience diarrhea because of several conditions or circumstances. Potential causes of diarrhea include:

viral infections including rotavirus, norovirus, and viral gastroenteritis
bacterial infections, including Salmonella and E. coli
parasitic infections
intestinal diseases
a food intolerance, such as lactose intolerance
an adverse reaction to a medication
gallbladder or stomach surgery

Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea globally. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this infection causes around 40 percent of hospitalizations in children under 5 years old. Globally, most diarrhea deaths are the result of contaminated water supplies and insufficient sanitation.

In the United States, you are more likely to develop diarrhea due to food poisoning from eating contaminated foodstuffs. According to the CDC, annually there are close to 48 million diarrheal illnesses caused by contaminated food in the United States.

Chronic diarrhea may be a symptom of a more severe condition such as irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease. Frequent and severe diarrhea could be a sign of intestinal disease or a functional bowel disorder."
endometriosis,"During a regular menstrual cycle, your body sheds the lining of your uterus. This allows menstrual blood to flow from your uterus through the small opening in the cervix and out through your vagina.

The exact cause of endometriosis isn’t known. There are severa theories regarding the cause, although no one theory has been scientifically proven.

One of the oldest theories is that endometriosis occurs due to a process called retrograde menstruation, which 90 percent of women experience, according to research. This happens when menstrual blood flows back through your fallopian tubes into your pelvic cavity instead of leaving your body through the vagina.

Another theory is that hormones transform the cells outside the uterus into cells similar to those lining the inside of the uterus, which are known as endometrial cells.

Others believe the condition may occur if small areas of your abdomen convert into endometrial-like tissue. This may happen because cells in your abdomen grow from embryonic cells, which can change shape and act like endometrial cells. It’s not known why this occurs.

These displaced endometrial cells may be on your pelvic walls and the surfaces of your pelvic organs, such as your bladder, ovaries, and rectum. They continue to grow, thicken, and bleed over the course of your menstrual cycle in response to the hormones of your cycle.

It’s also possible for the menstrual blood to leak into the pelvic cavity through a surgical scar, such as after a cesarean delivery, also commonly called a C-section.

Another theory is that the endometrial cells are transported out of the uterus through the lymphatic system. Still another theory purports it may be due to the immune system not working properly in destroying errant endometrial cells.

Some believe endometriosis might start in the fetal period with misplaced cell tissue that begins to respond to the hormones of puberty. This is often called Mullerian theory.

The development of endometriosis might also be linked to genetics or even environmental toxins."
epilepsy,"In about half of people with epilepsy, the cause cannot be determined, per the WHO. A variety of factors can contribute to the development of seizures, such as:

traumatic brain injury or other head trauma
brain scarring after a brain injury (post-traumatic epilepsy)
serious illness or very high fever
stroke, which causes about half of epilepsy cases in older adults when there’s no identifiable cause, according to the CDC
lack of oxygen to the brain
brain tumor or cyst
dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease
maternal use of some drugs, prenatal injury, brain malformation, or lack of oxygen at birth
infectious conditions like HIV and AIDS and meningitis
genetic or developmental disorders or neurological diseases"
fever,"Fever occurs when a part of the brain called the hypothalamus shifts the set point of your normal body temperature upward. When this happens, you may feel chilled and add layers of clothing, or you may start shivering to generate more body heat. This eventually results in a higher body temperature.

There are numerous different conditions that can trigger a fever. Some possible causes include:

infections, including the flu and pneumonia
some immunizations, such as diphtheria or tetanus (in children)
teething (in infants)
some inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn’s disease
blood clots
extreme sunburn
food poisoning
some medications, including antibiotics
Depending on the cause of the fever, additional symptoms may include:

sweating
shivering
headache
muscle aches
loss of appetite
dehydration
general weakness"
fibromyalgia,"Healthcare professionals and researchers do not know what causes fibromyalgia.

According to the latest research, the cause appears to involve a genetic disposition complemented by one or more triggers (such as infection, trauma, or stress).

Experts do not fully understand what causes the chronic widespread nature of fibromyalgia pain, either.

One theory is that the brain lowers the pain threshold. Sensations that were not painful before become very painful over time.

Another theory is that the brain and nerves may misinterpret or overreact to normal pain signals. They become more sensitive, to the point where they cause unnecessary or exaggerated pain. This may be due to a chemical imbalance in the brain or an abnormality in the dorsal root ganglion, which is a cluster of neurons in the spine.

Genes
Fibromyalgia often runs in families. If you have a family member with this condition, you’re at a higher risk for developing it.

Researchers think certain gene mutations may play a role. They’ve identified a few possible genes that affect the transmission of chemical pain signals between nerve cells.

Infections
A past illness could trigger fibromyalgia or make its symptoms worse. Infections that have possible links to fibromyalgia include:

flu
pneumonia
Epstein-Barr virus
gastrointestinal infections, such as those caused by the bacteria Salmonella and Shigella
Trauma
People who go through severe physical or emotional trauma may develop fibromyalgia. The condition has been linked to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Stress
Like trauma, stress can have long-lasting effects on your body. Stress has been linked to hormonal changes that could contribute to fibromyalgia."
gallstones,"The cause of gallstones is thought to be due to having too much cholesterol or bilirubin in your gallbladder.

Cholesterol: Too much cholesterol in your bile can lead to yellow cholesterol stones, which may develop if your liver makes more cholesterol than your bile can dissolve. Approximately 4 in 5 gallstones are made from cholesterol.
Bilirubin: This chemical is produced during the normal breakdown of red blood cells. After bilirubin is created, it passes through the liver and is excreted out of the body. These hard stones are often dark brown or black and form when your gallbladder can’t break down the excess bilirubin.
Gallstones may also happen if your gallbladder fails to properly empty its bile content. This bile can become overly concentrated, causing stones to form.

Gallbladder symptoms can sometimes happen after eating high fat foods, too."
GERD,"GERD commonly causes acid reflux, which may result from improper functioning of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

The LES is a circular band of muscle at the end of your esophagus. When you swallow, it relaxes and opens up to allow food and liquid to travel from your mouth to your stomach. Then, it tightens and closes again.

Acid reflux happens when your LES doesn’t tighten or close properly. This allows digestive juices and other contents of your stomach to rise up into your esophagus.

Your LES may not function properly if you:

Have a hiatal hernia: This occurs when part of your stomach moves above your diaphragm toward your chest. If your diaphragm is compromised, it may prevent your LES from functioning properly.
Frequently eat large meals: This may cause distension of the upper part of your stomach. This distension sometimes means there isn’t enough pressure on the LES, and it doesn’t close properly.
Lie down too soon after meals: This might not create enough pressure for the LES to function properly.

Other factors, including those listed below, may also contribute to having heartburn more than twice a week.

Lifestyle factors
Lifestyle factors that may contribute to persistent reflux with esophageal inflammation include:

smoking or being exposed to secondhand smoke
eating large meals before lying down
using an abundance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen
Health factors
Health factors such as the following may contribute to GERD:

obesity
pregnancy
connective tissue disorders
older age

Other conditions
Other health conditions that can worsen the symptoms of GERD include:

anxiety
pregnancy
asthma
irritable bowel syndrome

Alcohol
Studies suggest that drinking alcohol may increase the risk of GERD. The greater the quantity of alcohol and frequency of consumption, the greater the correlation.

If you’ve received a diagnosis of GERD, limiting or stopping alcohol intake may provide symptom relief.

Dietary triggers
Some foods may trigger GERD symptoms more than others, including:

high fat foods such as fried and fast foods
spicy foods
certain fruits and vegetables, such as pineapple, tomato, and citrus
certain liquids, such as coffee, tea, and carbonated drinks"
heart attack,"The leading cause of heart attacks is coronary heart disease. This is where plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. The general buildup of plaque in the arteries is also known as atherosclerosis.

There are two main types of heart attack.

Type I heart attacks are where plaque on the inner wall of the artery ruptures and releases cholesterol and other substances into the bloodstream. This can then form a blood clot and block the artery.

In type II heart attacks the heart does not receive as much oxygen-rich blood as it needs, but there is not a complete blockage of an artery.

Other causes of heart attacks include:

torn blood vessels
blood vessel spasms
drug misuse
hypoxia, lack of oxygen in the blood"
hemorrhoids,"Hemorrhoids occur when there’s too much pressure on the veins around your anus. Possible causes and risk factors include:

straining during a bowel movement
sitting for a long period of time, especially on the toilet
having chronic constipation or diarrhea
having a family history of hemorrhoids
engaging in consistent heavy lifting or other activities that strain your body
having obesity
having anal sexual intercourse, which can irritate hemorrhoids
being pregnant (an enlarged uterus presses on the vein in the colon, causing it to bulge)
being over the age of 50"
hepatitis A,"People develop a hepatitis A infection after contracting HAV. This virus is typically transmitted by ingesting food or liquid contaminated with fecal matter that contains the virus. Once transmitted, the virus spreads through the bloodstream to the liver, where it causes inflammation and swelling.

In addition to transmission from eating food or drinking water containing HAV, the virus can also be spread by close personal contact with someone who already has it. HAV is contagious, and a person who has hepatitis A can easily pass the disease to others living in the same household.

You can contract hepatitis A by:

eating food prepared by someone with the hepatitis A virus
eating food handled by preparers who don’t follow strict hand-washing routines before touching food that you eat
eating sewage-contaminated raw shellfish
having sex with someone who has the hepatitis A virus
drinking polluted water
coming in contact with hepatitis A-infected fecal matter"
hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. There are other forms of hepatitis, namely A, C, D, and E. Hepatitis B can cause an acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) infection.

The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through bodily fluids, especially blood. It can also be transmitted through semen and vaginal fluids. Although the virus can be detected in saliva, it’s not transmitted through saliva."
hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C is a liver disease that occurs due to HCV infection. HCV transmits through blood-to-blood contact.

This can happen as a result of:

using nonsterile needles, syringes, and other supplies to inject or inhale
pregnancy or childbirth
oral, vaginal, or anal sex without a condom or other barrier method
getting a tattoo or a piercing with nonsterile equipment
sharing personal hygiene items, like razors or toothbrushes
You have an increased risk of HCV infection if you:

have used injection drugs
have a sexual partner with hepatitis C
have HIV
received hemodialysis treatment for an extended period
received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before 1992
received clotting factor concentrates or other blood products before 1987"
hernia,"Hernias are caused by a combination of muscle weakness and strain. Depending on its cause, a hernia can develop quickly or over a long period of time.

Some common causes of muscle weakness or strain that can lead to a hernia include:

a congenital condition, which occurs during development in the womb and is present from birth
aging
damage from an injury or surgery
strenuous exercise or lifting heavy weights
chronic coughing or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)
pregnancy, especially having multiple pregnancies
constipation, which causes you to strain when having a bowel movement
being overweight or having obesity
ascites
There are also certain risk factors that make you more likely to develop a hernia. They include:

being born prematurely or having a low birth weight
being older
chronic cough (likely due to the repetitive increase in abdominal pressure)
cystic fibrosis
pregnancy
chronic constipation
being overweight or having obesity
smoking, which leads to the weakening of connective tissue
a personal or family history of hernias"
HIV,"HIV is caused by a virus and can be transmitted through sexual contact, sharing needles or injecting illicit drugs, and exposure to infected blood. It can also be passed from parent to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.

HIV targets and destroys white blood cells known as CD4 T cells, which are essential for the immune system to combat diseases. As the number of CD4 T cells decreases, the immune system becomes progressively weaker."
hives,"Hives are usually caused by an allergic reaction to something that you have encountered or swallowed. When you have an allergic reaction, your body begins to release histamines into your blood. Histamines are chemicals your body produces in an attempt to defend itself against infection and other outside intruders.

In some people, histamines can cause swelling, itching, and many of the symptoms that are experienced with hives. In terms of allergens, hives can be caused by factors such as pollen, medications, food, animal dander, and insect bites.

Hives might also be caused by circumstances besides allergies. It’s not uncommon for people to experience hives as the result of stress, tight clothes, exercise, illnesses, or infections.

It’s also possible to develop hives as the result of excessive exposure to hot or cold temperatures or from irritation due to excessive sweating. Because there are several potential triggers, many times the actual cause of hives can’t be determined."
kidney stones,"Kidney stones are most likely to occur in people between the ages of 20 and 50.

Different factors can increase your risk of developing a stone. In the United States, white people are more likely to have kidney stones than Black people.

Sex also plays a role. More men than women develop kidney stones, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)Trusted Source.

A history of kidney stones can increase your risk. So does a family history of kidney stones.

Other risk factors include:

dehydration
obesity
a diet with high levels of protein, salt, or glucose
hyperparathyroid condition
gastric bypass surgery
inflammatory bowel diseases that increase calcium absorption
taking medications such as triamterene diuretics, antiseizure drugs, and calcium-based antacids"
obesity,"Taking in more calories than you burn in daily activity and exercise — on a long-term basis — can lead to obesity. Over time, these extra calories add up and cause weight gain.

But it’s not always just about calories in and calories out or having a sedentary lifestyle. While those are indeed causes of obesity, some causes you can’t control.

Common specific causes of obesity include:

genetics, which can affect how your body processes food into energy and how fat is stored
growing older, which can lead to less muscle mass and a slower metabolic rate, making it easier to gain weight
not sleeping enough, which can lead to hormonal changes that make you feel hungrier and crave certain high calorie foods
high stress, which may trigger the production of hormones that cause you to eat more and store more fat
pregnancy, as weight gained during pregnancy may be difficult to lose and might eventually lead to obesity
Certain health conditions can also lead to weight gain, which may lead to obesity. These include:

metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors that include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high levels of triglycerides, low levels of HDL cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist that raise your chance of developing certain serious health conditions
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition that causes an imbalance of hormones called androgens
Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare condition present at birth that causes excessive hunger
Cushing syndrome, a condition caused by having high levels of cortisol (the stress hormone) in your system
hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough of certain important hormones
osteoarthritis (OA) and other conditions that cause pain that may lead to reduced activity"
osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis is caused by gradual joint and cartilage damage.

Cartilage is a tough, rubbery substance that protects the ends of bones within a joint, allowing them to move easily against each other. With osteoarthritis, this cartilage breaks down over time, leading to bones rubbing against each other. This may cause intense pain and other osteoarthritis symptoms.

Researchers don’t yet know the underlying cause of this gradual joint degeneration, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.

However, several osteoarthritis risk factors have been identified, which may contribute to the development and progression of the condition. These may include:

genetics, such as having a family member with the condition
past injuries, such as torn cartilage, dislocated joints, or ligament injuries
being age 50 years and older
being assigned female at birth
having overweight or obesity
having gone through menopause
having an occupation that involves kneeling, climbing, heavy lifting, or similar actions
having another medical condition that affects your joint health, such as a different type of arthritis"
osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease, significantly increasing the likelihood of fractures. Around half of women over 50 will suffer a fracture in the hip, wrist, or spine during their lifetime, with spine fractures being the most frequent.

To build and maintain strong bones, the body relies on calcium and phosphate. Throughout life, bones undergo a continuous process of breakdown and renewal. As long as this process remains balanced, bones stay strong. However, bone loss occurs when the body reabsorbs more bone than it produces. In some cases, this happens without an identifiable cause, while in others, it may run in families. Older white women are particularly at risk for bone loss.

Weak, brittle bones result from the body absorbing too much bone or failing to produce sufficient new bone. Aging can also lead to the loss of calcium and phosphate from bones, further weakening them.

A major factor in preventing bone loss is consuming enough calcium to support bone formation. It’s crucial to eat calcium-rich foods and get sufficient vitamin D, which aids in calcium absorption. Bones can become fragile and more prone to fractures if:

You don’t consume enough calcium and vitamin D.
Your body cannot effectively absorb calcium and vitamin D, which can occur after gastric bypass surgery or due to specific medical conditions.

Other causes of bone loss include:

Decreased estrogen in women after menopause and reduced testosterone in aging men.
Prolonged bed rest due to illness, particularly affecting children’s bones.
Chronic inflammatory conditions like Crohn’s disease or rheumatoid arthritis.
Certain medications, including seizure drugs, hormone therapies for prostate or breast cancer, and long-term use of steroids (over three months)."
Parkinson's disease,"The exact cause of Parkinson’s is unknown. It may have both genetic and environmental components. Some scientists believe that viruses can trigger Parkinson’s as well.

Low levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, a substance that regulates dopamine, have been linked with Parkinson’s.

Abnormal proteins called Lewy bodies have also been found in the brains of people with Parkinson’s. Scientists do not know what role, if any, Lewy bodies play in the development of Parkinson’s.

While there’s no known cause, research has identified groups of people who are more likely to develop the condition, which include:

Sex. Men are one and a half times more likely to develop Parkinson’s than women.
Race. According to research, there’s a higher prevalence of Parkinson’s in white people compared with Black or Asian people. Geographic location may be one reason for a higher risk.
Age. Parkinson’s usually appears between ages 50 and 60 years. It only occurs before 40 years old in about four percent of cases.
Family history. People who have close family members with Parkinson’s disease are more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease.
Toxins. Exposure to certain toxins may increase the risk of Parkinson’s disease.
Head injury. People who experience head injuries may be more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease."
psoriatic arthritis,"In PsA, your immune system attacks your joints and skin. Doctors don’t know for sure what causes these attacks. They think it stems from a combination of genes and environmental factors.

PsA runs in families. About 40% of people with the condition have one or more relatives with PsA. Something in the environment usually triggers the disease for those with a tendency to develop PsA. That could be a virus, extreme stress, or an injury."
cirrhosis,"Numerous diseases and conditions can damage the liver, potentially resulting in cirrhosis. Common causes include:

Chronic alcohol abuse.
Persistent viral hepatitis (types B, C, and D).
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by fat buildup in the liver.
Hemochromatosis, which causes excessive iron accumulation in the body.
Autoimmune hepatitis, where the immune system attacks liver cells.
Primary biliary cholangitis, leading to bile duct damage.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis, which causes bile duct scarring and hardening.
Wilson's disease, marked by copper buildup in the liver.
Genetic conditions such as cystic fibrosis or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
Biliary atresia, a condition involving malformed bile ducts.
Inherited disorders of sugar metabolism, such as galactosemia or glycogen storage disease.
Alagille syndrome, a genetic disorder affecting digestion.
Infections, including syphilis or brucellosis.
Certain medications, such as methotrexate or isoniazid.
These factors can progressively damage liver tissue, leading to cirrhosis."
delirium,"Delirium happens when stressors like inflammation or infection interfere with your brain function. There are many possible causes.

The condition is very common among older adults who need hospital care. Around one-third of hospital patients over age 70 experience delirium at some point during their hospital stay. It’s possible for younger people to experience delirium too, although it’s less common.

Any condition or factor that significantly changes your brain function can cause severe mental confusion. These include:

certain medications, such as sedatives, blood pressure medications, sleeping pills, and pain relievers
acute illness
infections
worsening symptoms of a long-term (chronic) illness
lack of oxygen — for example, breathing difficulties from asthma
blocked arteries (ischemia) — for example, in the brain or heart
severe pain
dehydration
sleep deprivation
metabolic issues, such as low blood sugar or an electrolyte imbalance
alcohol withdrawal in people with long-term, heavy alcohol use
surgery or general anesthesia
Medication side effects are a major cause of delirium. Up to 39% of the time, delirium is caused by medications."
epilepsy,"In about half of people with epilepsy, the cause cannot be determined, per the WHO. A variety of factors can contribute to the development of seizures, such as:

traumatic brain injury or other head trauma
brain scarring after a brain injury (post-traumatic epilepsy)
serious illness or very high fever
stroke, which causes about half of epilepsy cases in older adults when there’s no identifiable cause, according to the CDC
lack of oxygen to the brain
brain tumor or cyst
dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease
maternal use of some drugs, prenatal injury, brain malformation, or lack of oxygen at birth
infectious conditions like HIV and AIDS and meningitis
genetic or developmental disorders or neurological diseases
Epilepsy can develop at any age, but diagnosis usually occurs in early childhood or after 60 years old."
heart failure,"Heart failure happens when your heart muscle gets weak or stiff. This may then block or reduce blood flow to the heart.

The most common cause of heart failure is coronary artery disease (CAD). It happens when fatty deposits build up in your arteries, reducing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

Other conditions that may increase your risk of developing heart failure include:

heart attack
inherited heart disease
a condition that weakens the heart muscle, like cardiomyopathy
heart inflammation, like myocarditis
high blood pressure, also called hypertension
arrhythmia, which is an irregular heart rhythm
viral infection
congenital heart disease
diabetes
obesity
pressure in your lungs, called pulmonary hypertension
overactive thyroid, also known as hyperthyroidism
Certain behaviors may also increase your risk of developing heart failure, including:

smoking
drinking alcohol
eating foods high in fat or cholesterol
not getting enough physical activity"
peptic ulcer,"Different factors can cause the lining of the stomach, the esophagus, and the small intestine to break down. These include:

H. pylori, a type of bacteria that can cause a stomach infection and inflammation
frequent use of aspirin (Bayer), ibuprofen (Advil), and other anti-inflammatory drugs (risk associated with this behavior increases in women and people over the age of 60)
smoking
drinking too much alcohol
radiation therapy
stomach cancer"
urinary tract infection (UTI),"Anything that reduces your bladder emptying or irritates the urinary tract can lead to a UTI. There are also many factors that can put you at an increased risk of getting a UTI.

These risk factors include:

age (older adults are more likely to get UTIs)
reduced mobility after surgery or prolonged bed rest
kidney stones
a previous UTI
urinary tract obstructions or blockages, like:
enlarged prostate
kidney stones
certain forms of cancer
prolonged use of urinary catheters, which may make it easier for bacteria to get into your bladder
diabetes
pregnancy
abnormally developed urinary structures from birth
weakened immune system"
melanoma,"Melanoma develops when healthy melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells that give skin its color, transform into cancer cells. This pigment is called melanin.

Melanoma begins when the DNA of melanocytes undergoes changes. DNA contains the instructions that guide a cell's behavior. In healthy cells, DNA directs growth and division at a controlled pace and signals when cells should die. In cancer cells, changes in the DNA provide abnormal instructions, causing cells to multiply rapidly and avoid normal cell death. This leads to an accumulation of abnormal cells.

These cancerous cells may form a mass known as a tumor, which can grow and damage healthy tissues. Over time, the cancer cells may detach and spread to other parts of the body, a process called metastasis.

The exact cause of DNA changes in melanocytes that lead to melanoma is unclear. It is likely influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. However, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, from the sun or artificial sources like tanning beds, is considered the primary cause of melanoma.

Not all melanomas are caused by UV light, especially those occurring in areas of the body not exposed to sunlight. This suggests that additional factors may also play a role in increasing the risk of melanoma."
gastritis,"Weakness in your stomach lining allows digestive juices to damage and inflame it, causing gastritis. Having a thin or damaged stomach lining raises your risk for gastritis.

A gastrointestinal bacterial infection can also cause gastritis. The most common bacterial infection that causes it is H. pylori, a bacterium that infects the lining of the stomach. The infection is usually passed from person to person, but it can also be transmitted through contaminated food or water.

Certain conditions and activities may increase your risk for developing gastritis. Other risk factors include:

extreme alcohol consumption
routine use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen and aspirin
cocaine use
age, because the stomach lining thins naturally with age
tobacco use
Other less common risk factors include:

stress
autoimmune disorders
digestive disorders like Crohn’s disease
viral infections"
glaucoma,"The back of your eye continuously makes a clear fluid called aqueous humor. As this fluid is made, it fills the front part of your eye. Then, it leaves your eye through channels in your cornea and iris. If these channels are blocked or partially obstructed, the natural pressure in your eye, which is called the intraocular pressure (IOP), may increase. As your IOP increases, your optic nerve may become damaged. As damage to your nerve progresses, you may begin losing sight in your eye.

What causes the pressure in your eye to increase isn’t always known. However, doctors believe one or more of these factors may play a role:

dilating eye drops
blocked or restricted drainage in your eye
medications, such as corticosteroids
poor or reduced blood flow to your optic nerve
high or elevated blood pressure"
tachycardia,"Tachycardia refers to an abnormally fast heart rate. When caused by factors such as exercise or stress, it is known as sinus tachycardia, which is a symptom rather than a standalone condition.

Many heart conditions can lead to various forms of tachycardia, often linked to irregular heart rhythms, or arrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a common example of an arrhythmia that can result in tachycardia.

Other factors that may contribute to tachycardia include:

Fever.
Excessive alcohol consumption (14 or more drinks per week for men, or 7 or more drinks per week for women).
Alcohol withdrawal.
High caffeine intake.
High or low blood pressure.
Electrolyte imbalances, such as abnormal levels of potassium, sodium, calcium, or magnesium.
Certain medications.
Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).
Anemia (low red blood cell count).
Smoking or nicotine use.
Use of stimulant drugs, such as cocaine or methamphetamine.
Heart attack.
Identifying the underlying cause of tachycardia is essential for appropriate treatment and management."
anemia,"Red blood cells are produced in your bone marrow and have an average lifespan of 100 to 120 days. On average, your bone marrow produces 2 million red blood cells each second while approximately the same number are removed from circulation.

About 1 percent of your red blood cells are removed from circulation and replaced each day.

Any process that has a negative effect on this balance between red blood cell production and destruction can cause anemia.

Causes of anemia are generally divided into those that decrease red blood cell production and those that increase red blood cell destruction or loss.

Factors that decrease red blood cell production
When red blood cell production is lower than normal, more red blood cells are leaving your body than entering circulation. This can potentially lead to anemia.

Factors that decrease red blood cells production can be divided into two categories – acquired and inherited.

Acquired factors that can decrease RBC production include:

inadequate dietary intake of nutrients important for red blood cells production, such as iron, vitamin B12, or folate
kidney disease
some types of cancer, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma
autoimmune diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis
certain kinds of infections, such as HIV and tuberculosis
hypothyroidism
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) like ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease
aplastic anemia
certain types of medications or treatments, particularly chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer
exposure to toxins, such as lead
Some types of genetic (inherited) conditions are also associated with a decrease in production of healthy red blood cells. These include:

Fanconi anemia
Schwachman-Diamond syndrome
Diamond-Blackfan anemia
dyskeratosis congenita
amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia
Factors that increase red blood cell destruction or loss
On the other hand, anything that causes destruction or loss of red blood cells at a rate faster than they’re made can also cause anemia.

Factors that increase the destruction of red blood cells can also be either acquired or inherited.

Some acquired factors that may lead to increased red blood cell destruction or loss are:

blood loss, which can happen due to:
accidents or injuries
surgery
heavy menstrual bleeding
childbirth
endometriosis
gastrointestinal lesions, such as ulcers or those due to IBD or cancer
heavy nosebleeds
frequent blood donation
hemolysis, which is when red blood cells break down too soon due to things like:
autoimmune activity
certain infections
medication side effects
exposure to toxins
enlarged spleen
liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis
infections like malaria
Some inherited causes of increased red blood cell destruction can include:

sickle cell disease
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency
thalassemia
pyruvate kinase deficiency
hereditary spherocytosis
hereditary elliptocytosis"
pancreatitis,"Acute and chronic pancreatitis share many of the same causes. These include:

gallstones
drinking a lot of alcohol
some medications
pancreatic cancer
abdominal surgery
infections
cystic fibrosis
injury to your belly
High levels of calcium or triglycerides (a type of fat) in the blood can also lead to chronic pancreatitis.

Gallstones are the most common cause of acute pancreatitis. Gallstones are small, solid masses that form from bile, a fluid that helps with digestion.

A large enough gallstone can get stuck at the junction where the main pancreatic duct and the common bile duct come together. These ducts empty into the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine.

The pancreatic duct carries digestive enzymes from the pancreas. The common bile duct carries bile or other substances from the liver and the gallbladder.

A stuck gallstone can cause a backup of these substances, leading to inflammation in both the common bile duct and the pancreas.
"
tuberculosis,"A bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes TB. A variety of TB strains exist, and some of these have become resistant to medication.

TB bacteria are transmitted through infected droplets in the air. Once these droplets enter the air, anyone nearby can inhale them. Someone with TB can transmit bacteria by:

sneezing
coughing
speaking
singing
People with well-functioning immune systems may not experience TB symptoms, even if they’ve contracted the bacteria. This is known as latent or inactive TB infection. About a quarter of the world’s population has latent TB.

Latent TB is not contagious, but it can become active disease over time. Active TB disease can make you sick, and you can also spread it to others."
chickenpox,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes the chickenpox infection. Most cases occur through contact with an infected person. The virus is contagious to those around you for one to two days before your blisters appear. VZV remains contagious until all blisters have crusted over. The virus can spread through:

saliva
coughing
sneezing
contact with fluid from the blisters"
mumps,"Mumps is a viral infection that spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets, such as those released when sneezing. It can also be transmitted through direct contact with objects contaminated with infected saliva.

Mumps most commonly affects children aged 2 to 12 who have not been vaccinated, but it can occur at any age, including in college-aged individuals.

The incubation period, or the time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms, typically ranges from 12 to 25 days."
tetanus,"Bacteria called Clostridium tetani cause tetanus. Spores of the bacteria can be found in dust, dirt, and animal droppings. Spores are small reproductive bodies produced by certain organisms. They’re often resistant to harsh environmental conditions, such as high heat.

A person can become infected when these spores enter the bloodstream through a cut or deep wound. The bacteria spores then spread to the central nervous system and produce a toxin called tetanospasmin. This toxin is a poison that blocks the nerve signals from your spinal cord to your muscles. This can lead to severe muscle spasms.

Tetanus infection has been associated with:

crush injuries
injuries with dead tissue
burns
puncture wounds from piercings, tattoos, injection drug use, or injury (such as stepping on a nail)
wounds contaminated with dirt, feces, or saliva"
polio,"Polio is caused by the poliovirus, which primarily targets nerve cells in the spinal cord and brainstem responsible for muscle movement. Nerve cells involved in sensation are generally unaffected.

The wild-type poliovirus, the naturally occurring strain, has been eliminated in most countries and now accounts for only a few cases of polio. However, the majority of infections worldwide are caused by the vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), a variant of the virus more prevalent in regions using an oral vaccine containing a weakened form of the poliovirus.

The weakened virus in the oral vaccine does not directly cause polio, and individuals vaccinated with it rarely contract VDPV. Instead, VDPV emerges in areas where vaccination rates are low, allowing the virus to circulate and evolve within the community.

While the weakened virus from the oral vaccine does not cause illness itself, it can spread within a population. In communities with high vaccination coverage, the spread is controlled. However, in areas with low vaccination rates, the virus can circulate for extended periods, increasing the likelihood of mutations that cause it to behave like the wild-type virus.

Cases of VDPV have been reported in the United States, primarily in individuals who were unvaccinated or had compromised immune systems. One notable case in New York in 2022 occurred in a county with below-average vaccination rates, and wastewater analysis confirmed the presence of VDPV in some communities."
lupus,"While experts don’t know exactly what causes lupus, they think it may be a combination of many underlying factors. These may include:

Environment: A 2019 review identified potential triggers like smoking, stress, and exposure to toxins like silica dust as potential lupus causes.
Genetics: According to the Lupus Foundation of America, more than 50 genes associated with lupus have been identified. Additionally, having a family history of lupus may put a person at slightly higher risk for experiencing the condition.
Hormones: A 2019 review suggests that atypical hormone levels, such as increased estrogen levels, could contribute to lupus.
Infections: According to a 2021 review, experts are still studying the link between lupus and infections like cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr.
Medications: Long-term use of certain medications, such as hydralazine (Apresoline), procainamide (Procanbid), and quinidine, has been linked with DIL. Also, people taking TNF blocker medications for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease, and ankylosing spondylitis can develop DIL. Though rare, tetracyclines, like minocycline, which can be used to treat acne and rosacea, can cause DIL as well.
It’s also possible to have experienced none of the known potential causes of lupus listed here and still have the autoimmune disease."
hemophilia,"When a person bleeds, the body typically stops the bleeding by forming a clot. This process involves clotting factors, which are proteins in the blood, working together with platelets (specialized blood cells) to create the clot. Hemophilia occurs when a clotting factor is either missing or present at low levels.

Congenital Hemophilia
Hemophilia is most commonly inherited, meaning it is present from birth (congenital). Congenital hemophilia is categorized based on which clotting factor is deficient:

Hemophilia A: The most common type, caused by a deficiency of clotting factor 8.
Hemophilia B: The second most common type, caused by a deficiency of clotting factor 9.
Acquired Hemophilia
Some individuals develop hemophilia later in life, even without a family history of the disorder. This is known as acquired hemophilia.

Acquired hemophilia occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks clotting factor 8 or 9 in the blood. It is associated with conditions such as:

Pregnancy
Autoimmune diseases
Cancer
Multiple sclerosis
Drug reactions
Hemophilia Inheritance
In the most common forms of hemophilia, the faulty gene is located on the X chromosome. Every individual inherits two sex chromosomes, one from each parent. Females inherit one X chromosome from their mother and one X chromosome from their father, while males inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father.

Because the faulty gene is on the X chromosome, hemophilia primarily affects males and is typically passed from mother to son. Most women who carry the defective gene are asymptomatic carriers, although some may experience mild bleeding symptoms if their clotting factor levels are moderately reduced."
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS),"The cause of CFS is unknown. Researchers speculate that contributing factors may include:

viruses
a weakened immune system
stress
hormonal imbalances
It’s also possible that some people are genetically predisposed to develop CFS.

Though CFS can sometimes develop after a viral infection, no single type of infection has been found to cause CFS. Some viral infections that have been studied in relation to CFS include those caused by:

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
human herpesvirus 6
Ross River virus (RRV)
rubella virus
Infections caused by bacteria, including Coxiella burnetii and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, have also been studied in relation to CFS.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has suggested that CFS may be the end stage of multiple different conditions, rather than one specific condition.

In fact, about 1 in 10 people with EBV, Ross River virus, or Coxiella burnetii infection will develop a condition that meets the criteria for a CFS diagnosis.

Additionally, researchers say that those who’ve had severe symptoms with any of these three infections are at a higher risk for later developing CFS.

People with CFS sometimes have weakened immune systems, but doctors don’t know whether this is enough to cause the disorder.

People with CFS can also sometimes have abnormal hormone levels. Doctors haven’t yet concluded whether this is significant, either.

Some people with CFS may concomitantly have some deficiencies in vitamins including B2 (riboflavin) or B12, but it is unclear if they improve with vitamin supplementation."
