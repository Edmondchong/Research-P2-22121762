disease,cause
diabetes,"The different types of diabetes have different causes:

Researchers think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and factors in the environment that might trigger the disease.
Type 2 diabetes is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes. The lifestyle factors include not being physically active and being overweight or having obesity.
Researchers think gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors."
pneumonia,"Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections can cause pneumonia.

Bacteria are the most common cause. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own. It can also develop after you've had certain viral infections such as a cold or the flu. Several different types of bacteria can cause pneumonia, including:

Streptococcus pneumoniae
Legionella pneumophila; this type of pneumonia is often called Legionnaires' disease
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Chlamydia pneumoniae
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)

Viruses that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is often mild and goes away on its own within a few weeks. But sometimes it is serious enough that you need to get treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you are at risk of also getting bacterial pneumonia. The different viruses that can cause pneumonia include:

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
Some common cold and flu viruses
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19

Fungal pneumonia is more common in people who have chronic health problems or weakened immune systems. Some of the types include:

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)
Valley fever (Coccidioidomycosis)
Histoplasmosis
Cryptococcal pneumonia

Aspiration can also cause pneumonia. It can happen when you aspirate (accidentally breathe in) food or fluid into the lungs. If you are not able to cough out the food or fluid, it may cause an infection."
asthma,"The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics and your environment likely play a role in who gets asthma.

An asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma:

Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include
Dust mites
Mold
Pets
Pollen from grass, trees, and weeds
Waste from pests such as cockroaches and mice

Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as
Breathing in cold air
Certain medicines
Household chemicals
Infections such as colds and the flu
Outdoor air pollution
Tobacco smoke

Occupational asthma is caused by breathing in chemicals or industrial dusts at work
Exercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry

Asthma triggers may be different for each person and can change over time."
gout,"Gout happens when too much uric acid (urate) builds up in your body over a long time. Uric acid is a waste product your body makes when it breaks down purines. Purines are substances that are in your body's tissues and in many foods.

When your body breaks down old cells or digests foods that contain purine, most of the uric acid that's made dissolves in your blood. Your kidneys filter the uric acid out of your blood, and it leaves your body in your urine (pee).

However, sometimes your body can make too much uric acid or does not remove enough of it. Then the uric acid levels build up in your body, including in your blood. Having too much uric acid in the blood is called hyperuricemia. It does not cause health problems for everyone. But in some people, uric acid forms needle-like crystals. They can form in your joints, which causes gout. The crystals can also cause kidney stones.

Calcium pyrophosphate arthritis, sometimes called pseudogout, is a related disease. It causes similar symptoms and is sometimes confused with gout. But it is caused by a buildup of calcium phosphate, not uric acid."
malaria,"Malaria is caused by a parasite. It is passed to humans by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. After infection, the parasites (called sporozoites) travel through the bloodstream to the liver. There, they mature and release another form of parasites, called merozoites. The parasites enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells (RBCs).

The parasites multiply inside the red blood cells. The cells then break open within 48 to 72 hours and infect more red blood cells. The first symptoms usually occur 2 to 4 weeks after infection, though they can appear as early as 8 days or as long as a year after infection. The symptoms occur in cycles of 48 to 72 hours.

Most symptoms are caused by:

The release of merozoites into the bloodstream
Anemia resulting from the destruction of the red blood cells
Large amounts of free hemoglobin being released into circulation after red blood cells break open, which can damage other organs such as the kidneys
Malaria can also be transmitted from a mother to her unborn baby (congenitally) and by blood transfusions. Malaria can be carried by mosquitoes in temperate climates, but the parasite disappears over the winter.

The disease is a major health problem in much of the tropics and subtropics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2020 there were about 241 million cases of malaria. About 627,000 people died of it. Malaria is a major disease hazard for travelers to warm climates.

In some areas of the world, mosquitoes that carry malaria have developed resistance to insecticides. In addition, the parasites have developed resistance to some antibiotics. These conditions have made it hard to control both the rate of infection and spread of this disease."
migraine,"Researchers believe that migraine has a genetic cause. There are also a number of factors that can trigger a migraine. These factors vary from person to person, and they include:

Stress
Anxiety
Hormonal changes in women
Bright or flashing lights
Loud noises
Strong smells
Medicines
Too much or not enough sleep
Sudden changes in weather or environment
Overexertion (too much physical activity)
Tobacco
Caffeine or caffeine withdrawal
Skipped meals
Medication overuse (taking medicine for migraines too often)
Some people have found that certain foods or ingredients can trigger headaches, especially when they are combined with other triggers. These foods and ingredients include:

Alcohol
Chocolate
Aged cheeses
Monosodium glutamate (MSG)
Some fruits and nuts
Fermented or pickled goods
Yeast
Cured or processed meats"
appendicitis,"Appendicitis is a very common reason for emergency surgery. The problem most often occurs when the appendix becomes blocked by feces, a foreign object, a tumor or a parasite in rare cases."
diarrhea,"The most common causes of diarrhea include:

Bacteria from contaminated food or water
Viruses such as the flu, norovirus, or rotavirus . Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea in children.
Parasites, which are tiny organisms found in contaminated food or water
Medicines such as antibiotics, cancer drugs, and antacids that contain magnesium
Food intolerances and sensitivities, which are problems digesting certain ingredients or foods. An example is lactose intolerance.
Diseases that affect the stomach, small intestine, or colon, such as Crohn's disease
Problems with how the colon functions, such as irritable bowel syndrome

Some people also get diarrhea after stomach surgery, because sometimes the surgeries can cause food to move through your digestive system more quickly.

Sometimes no cause can be found. If your diarrhea goes away within a few days, finding the cause is usually not necessary."
endometriosis,"Every month, a woman's ovaries produce hormones that tell the cells lining the uterus to swell and get thicker. Your uterus sheds these cells along with blood and tissue through your vagina when you have your period.

Endometriosis occurs when these cells grow outside the uterus in other parts of your body. This tissue may attach on your:

Ovaries
Fallopian tubes
Bowel
Rectum
Bladder
Lining of your pelvic area

It can grow in other areas of the body, too.

These growths stay in your body, and like the cells in the lining of your uterus, these growths react to the hormones from your ovaries. This may cause you to have pain during the month prior to the onset of your period. Over time, the growths may add more tissue and blood. Growths can also build up in the abdomen and pelvis, leading to chronic pelvic pain, heavy cycles, and infertility.

The cause of endometriosis is unknown. One idea is that when you get your period, the cells may travel backwards through the fallopian tubes into the pelvis. Once there, the cells attach and grow. However, this backward period flow occurs in many women. The immune system may play a role in causing endometriosis in women with the condition.

Endometriosis is common. It occurs in about 10% of women of reproductive age. Sometimes, it may run in families. Endometriosis probably starts when a woman begins having periods. However, it usually is not diagnosed until ages 25 to 35.

You are more likely to develop endometriosis if you:

Have a mother or sister with endometriosis
Started your period at a young age
Never had children
Have frequent periods, or they last 7 or more days"
epilepsy,"Epilepsy has many possible causes, including illness, brain injury, and abnormal brain development. In many cases, the cause is unknown."
fever,"A fever is a body temperature that is higher than normal. A normal temperature can vary from person to person, but it is usually around 98.6 °F (37 °C). A fever is not a disease. It is usually a sign that your body is trying to fight an illness or infection.

Infections cause most fevers. You get a fever because your body is trying to kill the virus or bacteria that caused the infection. Most of those bacteria and viruses do well when your body is at your normal temperature. But if you have a fever, it is harder for them to survive. Fever also activates your body's immune system.

Other causes of fevers include:

Medicines, including some antibiotics, blood pressure medicines, and anti-seizure medicines
Heat illness
Cancers
Autoimmune diseases
Some childhood vaccines"
fibromyalgia,"Fibromyalgia is known to run in families, suggesting that genetic factors contribute to the risk of developing this disease. However, little is known for certain about the genetic basis of fibromyalgia. It is likely that variations in many genes, each with a small effect, combine to increase the risk of developing this condition.

The signs and symptoms of fibromyalgia are related to the way the brain recognizes and interprets pain signals. People with fibromyalgia have an increased sensitivity to pain; they feel pain more acutely than others would in response to a given stimulus. Researchers describe this phenomenon as the ""volume"" of pain sensations being turned up too high (pain amplification). Studies of the genetics of fibromyalgia have focused on genes with roles in the way the brain processes pain. For example, several genes that may influence the condition are involved in the production and breakdown of certain chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. These chemicals relay signals between nerve cells that can increase or decrease the sensation of pain, a process known as pain modulation.

Nongenetic (environmental) factors also play critical roles in a person's risk of developing fibromyalgia. The disorder can be triggered by infection or illness that would not otherwise cause chronic pain, injury, and other physical stress. Psychological and social factors such as a history of childhood abuse or neglect, exposure to war or other catastrophic events, and low job or life satisfaction have also been associated with an increased risk of fibromyalgia. Additionally, physical inactivity, obesity, and sleep disturbances seem to increase risk. However, many people who develop this condition do not have any recognized triggers or risk factors. It is likely that environmental conditions interact with genetic factors to determine the overall risk of developing this disorder."
gallstones,"The cause of gallstones varies. There are two main types of gallstones:

Stones made of cholesterol -- This is the most common type. Cholesterol gallstones are not related to cholesterol level in the blood. In most cases, they are not visible on CT scans but are visible on a sonogram (ultrasound) of the abdomen.
Stones made of bilirubin -- These are called pigment stones. They occur when red blood cells are destroyed and too much bilirubin is in the bile."
GERD,"GERD, or gastroesophageal reflux disease, often leads to acid reflux due to dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

The LES is a ring of muscle located at the lower end of the esophagus. It relaxes to allow food and liquids to pass from the esophagus into the stomach and then tightens to prevent backflow. However, acid reflux occurs when the LES does not close properly, allowing stomach contents, including digestive juices, to flow back into the esophagus.

Factors Affecting LES Function
The LES may not work effectively due to:

Hiatal hernia: When part of the stomach pushes above the diaphragm, it can impair the LES's ability to close.
Large meals: Overeating can distend the stomach, reducing pressure on the LES and hindering its function.
Lying down soon after eating: This can decrease the pressure needed for the LES to function correctly.
Other Contributing Factors
Persistent reflux and esophageal inflammation may result from several lifestyle and health factors:

Lifestyle factors:

Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke
Consuming large meals before lying down
Excessive use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like aspirin or ibuprofen
Health factors:

Obesity
Pregnancy
Connective tissue disorders
Older age
Other health conditions:

Anxiety
Asthma
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
Pregnancy
Alcohol and GERD
Research indicates that alcohol consumption may increase GERD risk, with stronger correlations seen with higher quantities and frequency. Reducing or avoiding alcohol can help alleviate symptoms.

Dietary Triggers
Certain foods and beverages can aggravate GERD symptoms, such as:

High-fat foods like fried or fast foods
Spicy foods
Specific fruits and vegetables, including citrus, tomatoes, and pineapple
Beverages like coffee, tea, and carbonated drinks
If diagnosed with GERD, lifestyle adjustments, dietary changes, and limiting alcohol intake can help manage symptoms effectively."
heart attack,"A substance called plaque can build up in the walls of your coronary arteries. This plaque is made up of cholesterol and other cells.

A heart attack may occur when:

A disruption in the plaque occurs. This triggers blood platelets and other substances to form a blood clot at the site that blocks most or all of the oxygen-carrying blood from flowing to a part of the heart muscle. This is the most common cause of heart attack.
The cause of heart attack is not always known, but there are well known risk factors.

Heart attack may occur:

When you are resting or asleep
After a sudden increase in physical activity
When you are active outside in cold weather
After sudden, severe emotional or physical stress, including an illness"
hemorrhoids,"Hemorrhoids are very common. They result from increased pressure on the anus. This can occur during pregnancy or childbirth, and due to constipation. The pressure causes the normal anal veins and tissue to swell. This tissue can bleed, often during bowel movements.

Hemorrhoids may be caused by:

Straining during bowel movements
Constipation
Sitting for long periods of time, especially on the toilet
Certain diseases, such as cirrhosis"
hepatitis A,"Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus spreads through contact with an infected person's stool. This can happen if you:

Eat food made by someone who has the virus and did not properly wash their hands after using the bathroom
Drink contaminated water or eat foods that were rinsed with contaminated water
Have close personal contact with someone who has hepatitis A. This could be through certain types of sex (like oral-anal sex), taking care of someone who is ill, or using illegal drugs with others."
hepatitis B,"You can catch hepatitis B infection through contact with the blood or body fluids (semen, vaginal fluids, and saliva) of a person who has the virus.

Exposure may occur:

After a needlestick or sharps injury
If any blood or other body fluid touches your skin, eyes or mouth, or open sores or cuts
People who may be at risk for hepatitis B are those who:

Have unprotected sex with an infected partner
Receive blood transfusions (not common in the United States)
Have contact with blood at work (such as health care workers)
Have been on long-term kidney dialysis
Get a tattoo or acupuncture with unclean needles
Share needles or straws during drug use
Share personal items (such as toothbrush, razor, and nail clippers) with a person who has the virus
Were born to a hepatitis-B infected mother
All blood used for blood transfusions is screened, so the chance of getting the virus in this way is very small."
hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C infection is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV).

You can catch hepatitis C if the blood of someone who has HCV enters your body. Exposure may occur:

After a needle stick or sharps injury
If blood from someone who has HCV contacts a cut on your skin or contacts your eyes or mouth
While injecting street drugs
People at risk for HCV are those who:

Inject street drugs or share a needle with someone who has HCV
Have been on long-term kidney dialysis
Have regular contact with blood at work (such as a health care worker)
Have unprotected sexual contact with a person who has HCV
Were born to a mother who had HCV
Received a tattoo or acupuncture with needles that were not disinfected properly after being used on another person (risk is very low with practitioners who have a tattoo license or permit or an acupuncture license)
Received an organ transplant from a donor who has HCV
Share personal items, such as toothbrushes and razors, with someone who has HCV (less common)
Received a blood transfusion (rare in the United States since blood screening became available in 1992)"
hernia,"Hernias result from a combination of muscle weakness and strain, and they may develop rapidly or gradually depending on the underlying cause.

Some common causes of muscle weakness or strain that can contribute to the formation of a hernia include:

A congenital condition present from birth due to development in the womb
Aging
Injury or surgical damage
Strenuous physical activity or heavy lifting
Chronic coughing or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Pregnancy, particularly multiple pregnancies
Constipation, leading to straining during bowel movements
Being overweight or obese
Ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen)
Certain risk factors also increase the likelihood of developing a hernia, including:

Premature birth or low birth weight
Advanced age
Chronic coughing (due to repeated abdominal pressure)
Cystic fibrosis
Pregnancy
Chronic constipation
Obesity or being overweight
Smoking, which weakens connective tissue
A personal or family history of hernias"
HIV,"HIV is spread through certain body fluids from a person who has HIV. This can happen:

By having unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a person who has HIV. ""Unprotected"" means not using condoms or medicine to treat or prevent HIV. This is the most common way that it spreads.
By sharing drug needles.
Through contact with the blood of a person with HIV.
From mother to baby during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding."
hives,"When you have an allergic reaction to a substance, your body releases histamine and other chemicals into the blood. This causes itching, swelling, and other symptoms. Hives are a common reaction. People with other allergies, such as hay fever, often get hives.

Angioedema is swelling of the deeper tissue that sometimes occurs with hives. Like hives, angioedema can occur on any part of the body. When it occurs around the mouth or throat, the symptoms can be severe, including airway blockage.

Many substances can trigger hives, including:

Animal dander (especially cats)
Insect bites
Medicines
Pollen
Shellfish, fish, nuts, eggs, milk, and other foods"
kidney stones,"Genetic changes can increase the risk of developing kidney stones, often acting in combination with a variety of environmental and lifestyle factors. Most genes involved in the condition are important for transmitting chemical signals from outside cells to inside cells or transporting materials in and out of cells. These processes help regulate the levels of various materials within cells, including the minerals and compounds that make up kidney stones. Changes in these genes can alter the levels of these materials in cells, leading to an imbalance of minerals and compounds in urine. As a result, the likelihood of stone formation increases.

A key factor that contributes to the development of kidney stones is too little water in the body (dehydration). When a person is dehydrated, they excrete less water in their urine, so the urine becomes concentrated with minerals and compounds that can cluster to form stones. Eating certain foods, such as animal proteins or foods high in sodium, can increase the likelihood of developing stones. A diet deficient in calcium can increase levels of other substances that cause stone development in individuals who have a history of kidney stones. Additionally, people who take certain medications, such as diuretics, which help remove water and salt from the body through urine, or calcium antacids, which treat indigestion by neutralizing stomach acids, are more likely to develop kidney stones.

In most cases, kidney stones occur without any other health issues. However, some people develop kidney stones as part of another condition. About half of people who develop calcium stones have high levels of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria). Hypercalciuria often runs in families. Some other health conditions that increase the risk of kidney stones include obesity, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (abnormal inflammation of the intestinal walls), gout (abnormal inflammation in the joints caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood), hyperparathyroidism (overactivity of the parathyroid glands), renal tubular acidosis (kidney dysfunction that leads to too much acid in the blood), and recurrent urinary tract infections."
obesity,"Taking in more calories than your body uses can lead to obesity. This is because your body stores unused calories as fat. Obesity can be caused by:

Eating more food than your body can use
Drinking too much alcohol
Not getting enough exercise
Many people with obesity who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost.

Today, we know that biology is a big reason why some people cannot keep the weight off. Some people who live in the same place and eat the same foods develop obesity, while others do not. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system does not work as well as it should.

The way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults.

The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat.

We may feel that we are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active.

Many people feel they do not have time to plan and make healthy meals.
Many people do not have ready access to healthy foods making it difficult to plan and make healthy meals.
More people today work desk jobs compared to more active jobs in the past.
People with little free time may have less time to exercise.
The term eating disorder means a group of medical conditions that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. A person may have obesity, follow an unhealthy diet, and have an eating disorder all at the same time.

Sometimes, medical problems or treatments cause or contribute to weight gain, including:

Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)
Medicines such as birth control pills, antidepressants, and antipsychotics
Other things that can cause weight gain are:

Quitting smoking -- Many people who quit smoking gain 4 to 10 pounds (lb) or 2 to 5 kilograms (kg) in the first 6 months after quitting.
Stress, anxiety, feeling sad, depression, or not sleeping well.
Menopause -- Women may gain 12 to 15 lb (5.5 to 7 kg) during menopause.
Pregnancy -- Women may not lose the weight they gained during pregnancy."
osteoarthritis,"Common variations that affect many genes, some of which are unidentified, contribute to the risk of developing osteoarthritis. The condition was once believed to be caused primarily by ""wear and tear"" damage to the joints over time. However, it is now thought to be mainly the result of the body's failed attempts to repair this damage. In healthy cartilage, there is a balance between buildup and breakdown of the tissue. This balance is lost in osteoarthritis, leading to cartilage damage and, over time, complete breakdown. Without the protection of the cartilage, bone damage occurs at the joint. In response, the body builds new bone, which leads to overgrowth and reduced mobility of the joints. In addition, the cartilage damage triggers an immune response, causing inflammation of other joint tissues and leading to further joint damage.

The majority of variations associated with osteoarthritis risk are thought to act by subtly changing the amount, timing, and location of gene activity (expression). The genes whose expression influences osteoarthritis risk are typically involved in the formation and maintenance of bone and cartilage. For example, some of these genes are involved in the development of cartilage; if the genes are not expressed in the right location, at the right time, or in the right amount due to genetic variations, the function of this tissue may be impaired and the risk of developing osteoarthritis may be increased.

In most cases, multiple genetic changes, each with a small effect, combine to increase the risk of developing the disorder. The genetic changes can also interact with environmental and lifestyle factors that are associated with osteoarthritis risk, such as obesity and activity that places excessive stress on the joints."
osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is the most common type of bone disease.

Osteoporosis increases the risk for breaking a bone. About one half of all women over the age of 50 will have a fracture of the hip, wrist, or vertebra (bones of the spine) during their lifetime. Spine fractures are the most common.

Your body needs the minerals calcium and phosphate to make and keep healthy bones.

During your life, your body continues to both reabsorb old bone and create new bone.
As long as your body has a good balance of new and old bone, your bones stay healthy and strong.
Bone loss occurs when more old bone is reabsorbed than new bone is created.
Sometimes, bone loss occurs without any known cause. Other times, bone loss and thin bones run in families. In general, white, older women are the most likely to have bone loss.

Brittle, fragile bones can be caused by anything that makes your body reabsorb too much bone, or keeps your body from making enough new bone. As you age, your body may reabsorb calcium and phosphate from your bones instead of keeping these minerals in your bones. This makes your bones weaker.

A major risk is not consuming enough calcium to build new bone tissue. It is important to eat/drink enough high-calcium foods. You also need vitamin D, because it helps your body absorb calcium. Your bones may become brittle and more likely to fracture if:

If you do not eat enough food with calcium and vitamin D
Your body does not absorb enough calcium and vitamin D from your food, such as after gastric bypass surgery or due to other medical conditions
Other causes of bone loss include:

A decrease in estrogen in women at the time of menopause and a decrease in testosterone in men as they age
Being confined to a bed due to a prolonged illness (mostly affects bones in children)
Having certain medical conditions that cause increased inflammation in the body such as Crohn disease or rheumatoid arthritis
Taking certain medicines, such as certain seizure medicines, hormone treatments for prostate or breast cancer, and steroid medicines taken for more than 3 months"
Parkinson's disease,"Nerve cells use a brain chemical called dopamine to help control muscle movement. With Parkinson disease, the brain cells that make dopamine slowly die. Without enough dopamine, the cells that control movement can't send proper messages to the muscles. This makes it hard to control the muscles. Slowly, over time, this damage gets worse. No one knows exactly why these brain cells waste away.

Parkinson disease most often develops after age 60. It is one of the most common nervous system problems in older adults.

The disease affects men more often than women, although women also develop the disease. Parkinson disease sometimes runs in families.
The disease can occur in younger adults. In such cases, it is often due to the person's genes.
Parkinson disease is rare in children."
psoriatic arthritis,"The specific cause of psoriatic arthritis is unknown. Its signs and symptoms result from excessive inflammation in and around the joints. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. When this has been accomplished, the body ordinarily stops the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues. Mechanical stress on the joints, such as occurs in movement, may result in an excessive inflammatory response in people with psoriatic arthritis. The reasons for this excessive inflammatory response are unclear.

Researchers have identified changes in several genes that may influence the risk of developing psoriatic arthritis. The most well-studied of these genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. Variations of several HLA genes seem to affect the risk of developing psoriatic arthritis, as well as the type, severity, and progression of the condition.

Variations in several other genes have also been associated with psoriatic arthritis. Many of these genes are thought to play roles in immune system function. However, variations in these genes probably make only a small contribution to the overall risk of developing psoriatic arthritis. Other genetic and environmental factors are also likely to influence a person's chances of developing this disorder."
cirrhosis,"Cirrhosis is most often the end result of chronic liver damage caused by long-term (chronic) liver disease. Common causes of chronic liver disease in the United States are:

Hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.
Alcohol overuse.
Buildup of fat in the liver that is NOT caused by drinking too much alcohol (called metabolic associated steatotic liver disease [MASLD] or metabolic associated steatohepatitis [MASH]). It is closely related to being overweight, having high blood pressure, diabetes or pre-diabetes, and high cholesterol.
Less common causes of cirrhosis include:

When immune cells mistake the liver's normal cells for harmful invaders and attack them, called autoimmune hepatitis (AH)
Bile duct disorders
Some medicines
Liver diseases passed down in families"
delirium,"Delirium is most often caused by physical or mental illness and is usually temporary and reversible. Many disorders may cause delirium. Often, these disorders do not allow the brain to get oxygen or other substances. They may also cause dangerous chemicals (toxins) to build up in the brain. Delirium is common in the intensive care unit (ICU), especially in older adults.

Causes include:

Alcohol or medicine overdose or withdrawal
Drug use or overdose, including being sedated in the ICU
Electrolyte or other body chemical disturbances
Infections such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia, or meningitis
Severe lack of sleep
Poisons
General anesthesia and surgery
Autoimmune disease"
epilepsy,"In about half of all cases, the cause of epilepsy is unknown. For the other half, the condition may be linked to various factors, including:

Genetic factors: Some forms of epilepsy are hereditary, suggesting a genetic component. Researchers have identified specific genes associated with certain types of epilepsy. However, some individuals may have genetic epilepsy that is not inherited, as genetic mutations can occur spontaneously. Typically, genes are only part of the equation, with environmental factors potentially triggering seizures in genetically predisposed individuals.

Head trauma: Severe head injuries, such as those sustained in car accidents or other traumatic events, can lead to epilepsy.

Brain-related factors: Brain tumors and abnormalities in blood vessel formation, such as arteriovenous or cavernous malformations, can cause epilepsy. In adults over 35, strokes are a leading cause.

Infections: Conditions such as meningitis, HIV, viral encephalitis, and certain parasitic infections can result in epilepsy.

Prenatal injury: The developing brain of a fetus is particularly vulnerable to damage from maternal infections, poor nutrition, or oxygen deprivation, potentially leading to epilepsy or cerebral palsy.

Developmental conditions: Epilepsy often occurs alongside developmental disorders. For example, individuals with autism are at a higher risk of epilepsy. Similarly, epilepsy is more common in those with ADHD or other developmental conditions, likely due to shared genetic factors.

Seizure Triggers
While triggers do not cause epilepsy, they can provoke seizures in those with the condition. Not everyone with epilepsy has consistent triggers, but many can identify factors that increase their likelihood of experiencing a seizure. Common triggers include:

Alcohol consumption.
Flashing lights.
Use of illicit drugs.
Missing doses or taking incorrect doses of antiseizure medication.
Sleep deprivation.
Hormonal changes, such as during the menstrual cycle.
Stress.
Dehydration.
Skipped meals.
Illness.
Understanding these factors can help manage and reduce the risk of seizures."
heart failure,"Heart failure is most often a long-term (chronic) condition, but it may come on suddenly. It can be caused by many different heart problems.

The condition may affect only the right side or only the left side of the heart. Both sides of the heart also can be involved.

Heart failure is present when:

Your heart muscle cannot contract very well. This is called systolic heart failure, or heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
Your heart muscle is stiff and does not fill up with blood easily even though pumping power is normal. This is called diastolic heart failure, or heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
As the heart's pumping becomes less effective, blood may back up in other areas of the body. Fluid may build up in the lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and the arms and legs. This is called congestive heart failure or, more simply, just heart failure.

Other diseases that can cause or contribute to heart failure:

Amyloidosis
Emphysema
Overactive thyroid
Sarcoidosis
Severe anemia
Too much iron in the body (usually due to hereditary hemochromatosis)
Underactive thyroid

The most common causes of heart failure are:

Coronary artery disease (CAD), a narrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. This can weaken the heart muscle over time or suddenly.
High blood pressure that is not well controlled, leading to problems with stiffness, or eventually leading to muscle weakening.

Other heart problems that may cause heart failure are:

Congenital heart disease
Heart attack (when coronary artery disease results in a sudden blockage of a heart artery)
Heart valves that are leaky or narrowed
Infection that weakens the heart muscle
Some types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)"
peptic ulcer,"Normally, the lining of the stomach and small intestines can protect itself against strong stomach acids. But if the lining breaks down, the result may be:

Swollen and inflamed tissue (gastritis)
An ulcer

Most ulcers occur in the first, inner surface, layer of the inner lining. A hole in the stomach or duodenum is called a perforation. This is a medical emergency.

The most common cause of ulcers is infection of the stomach by bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H pylori). Most people with peptic ulcers have these bacteria living in their digestive tract. Yet, many people who have these bacteria in their stomach do not develop an ulcer.

The following factors raise your risk for peptic ulcers:

Drinking too much alcohol
Regular use of aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco
Being very ill, such as being on a breathing machine
Radiation treatments
Stress
A rare condition, called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, causes the stomach to produce too much acid, leading to stomach and duodenal ulcers."
urinary tract infection (UTI),"Anything that impairs bladder emptying or irritates the urinary tract can contribute to the development of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Several factors can increase the risk of experiencing a UTI, including:

Age: Older adults are more prone to UTIs.
Reduced mobility: Prolonged bed rest or recovery after surgery can increase the risk.
Kidney stones: These can obstruct urine flow, promoting bacterial growth.
History of UTIs: A previous UTI can raise the likelihood of recurrence.
Urinary tract obstructions or blockages, such as:
Enlarged prostate.
Kidney stones.
Certain types of cancer.
Prolonged use of urinary catheters: This can facilitate the entry of bacteria into the bladder.
Diabetes: High blood sugar levels can promote bacterial growth.
Pregnancy: Hormonal and physical changes during pregnancy can increase susceptibility.
Congenital abnormalities: Structural abnormalities of the urinary tract present from birth can impair urine flow.
Weakened immune system: Conditions that compromise the immune system make it harder to fight infections.
Recognizing these risk factors can help in prevention and management of UTIs."
melanoma,"Melanoma is caused by changes (mutations) in skin cells called melanocytes. These cells make a skin color pigment called melanin. Melanin is responsible for skin and hair color.

Melanoma can appear on normal skin. Sometimes it can develop from moles. Moles that are present at birth may develop into melanomas. Larger moles that are present at birth may be at higher risk for developing melanoma.

There are four major types of melanoma:

Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common type. It is usually flat and irregular in shape and color, with different shades of black and brown. It is most common in fair skin people.
Nodular melanoma usually starts as a raised area that is dark blackish-blue or bluish-red. Some do not have any color (amelanotic melanoma).
Lentigo maligna melanoma usually occurs in older people. It is most common in sun-damaged skin on the face, neck, and arms. The abnormal skin areas are usually large, flat, and tan with areas of brown.
Acral lentiginous melanoma is the least common form. It usually occurs on the palms, soles, or under the nails.

The risk for developing melanoma increases with age. However, more and more young people are developing it.

You are more likely to develop melanoma if you:

Have fair skin, blue or green eyes, or red or blond hair
Live in sunny climates or at high altitudes
Spent a lot of time in high levels of strong sunlight because of a job or other activities
Have had one or more blistering sunburns during childhood
Use tanning devices, such as tanning beds
Other risk factors include:

Having close relatives with melanoma
Certain types of moles (atypical or dysplastic) or many birthmarks
Weakened immune system due to disease or medicines
"
gastritis,"The most common causes of gastritis are:

Certain medicines, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen and other similar drugs
Heavy alcohol drinking
Infection of the stomach with a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori
Less common causes are:

Autoimmune disorders (such as pernicious anemia)
Backflow of bile into the stomach (bile reflux)
Cocaine use
Eating or drinking caustic or corrosive substances (such as poisons)
Extreme stress
Viral infection, such as cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus (more often occurs in people with a weak immune system)
Trauma or a severe, sudden illness such as major surgery, kidney failure, or being placed on a breathing machine may cause gastritis."
glaucoma,"Glaucoma occurs when the optic nerve becomes damaged, leading to the development of blind spots in vision. This nerve damage is often associated with increased pressure in the eye, though the exact reasons for the damage are not fully understood by eye specialists.

Increased eye pressure results from the buildup of fluid, known as aqueous humor, inside the eye. This fluid typically drains through a tissue called the trabecular meshwork, located at the angle where the iris and cornea meet. The cornea plays a crucial role in vision by allowing light to enter the eye. If the eye produces too much fluid or if the drainage system is impaired, eye pressure can rise.

Types of Glaucoma
Open-Angle Glaucoma
The most common form, this occurs when the drainage angle between the iris and cornea remains open, but other parts of the drainage system do not function properly. This leads to a gradual increase in eye pressure over time.

Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma
This form arises when the iris bulges, blocking the drainage angle either partially or completely. Fluid becomes trapped, causing a rapid or gradual rise in eye pressure.

Normal-Tension Glaucoma
In this type, the optic nerve becomes damaged despite normal eye pressure. The cause is unclear but may involve increased sensitivity of the optic nerve or reduced blood flow, possibly due to atherosclerosis (buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries) or other circulation-related conditions.

Glaucoma in Children
Glaucoma can affect children from birth or during their early years. Causes may include blocked drainage, injury, or underlying medical conditions leading to optic nerve damage.

Pigmentary Glaucoma
In this form, pigment granules from the iris flake off and obstruct or slow the drainage of fluid. Physical activities like jogging may dislodge these granules, causing them to accumulate at the drainage angle and increase eye pressure.

Genetic Factors
Glaucoma often runs in families. Scientists have identified certain genes associated with high eye pressure and optic nerve damage, suggesting a hereditary component to the condition."
tachycardia,"Tachycardia refers to an abnormally fast heart rate. When it is triggered by factors like exercise or stress, it is called sinus tachycardia. Sinus tachycardia is considered a symptom rather than a medical condition.

Various heart-related issues can cause different types of tachycardia, including irregular heart rhythms known as arrhythmias. A common example of an arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation (AFib).

Other potential causes of tachycardia include:

Fever.
Excessive alcohol consumption, defined as 14 or more drinks per week for men and 7 or more drinks per week for women.
Alcohol withdrawal.
Excessive caffeine intake.
High or low blood pressure.
Imbalances in body minerals (electrolytes), such as potassium, sodium, calcium, or magnesium.
Certain medications.
Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism).
Anemia (a low red blood cell count).
Smoking or nicotine use.
Use of illegal stimulants, such as cocaine or methamphetamine.
Heart attack.
Recognizing these underlying causes is important for managing tachycardia effectively."
anemia,"Anemia occurs when the blood has insufficient levels of hemoglobin or red blood cells. This can happen due to:

The body not producing enough hemoglobin or red blood cells.
Loss of red blood cells and hemoglobin due to bleeding faster than they can be replenished.
The body destroying red blood cells and their hemoglobin.
Role of Red Blood Cells
Blood contains three types of cells:

White blood cells: Fight infection.
Platelets: Help with blood clotting.
Red blood cells: Carry oxygen to the body and remove carbon dioxide.
Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. Hemoglobin allows red blood cells to transport oxygen from the lungs to tissues and carbon dioxide from tissues back to the lungs for exhalation.

Red blood cells and hemoglobin are produced in the bone marrow, the spongy tissue within large bones. The production process requires nutrients like iron, vitamin B-12, folate, and other dietary components.

Causes of Anemia
Different types of anemia have various causes, including:

Iron-deficiency anemia: The most common type, caused by insufficient iron. Iron is necessary for the bone marrow to produce hemoglobin. It can result from inadequate dietary iron, blood loss (e.g., heavy menstrual periods, ulcers, cancer), or lack of iron supplementation during pregnancy.

Vitamin deficiency anemia: Inadequate folate or vitamin B-12 in the diet can hinder red blood cell production. Some people cannot absorb vitamin B-12 properly, leading to pernicious anemia.

Anemia of inflammation: Chronic diseases like cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, or Crohn's disease can interfere with red blood cell production.

Aplastic anemia: A rare but life-threatening condition where the body stops making enough new blood cells. Causes include infections, certain medications, autoimmune diseases, and exposure to toxic chemicals.

Anemias related to bone marrow diseases: Disorders like leukemia or myelofibrosis can disrupt red blood cell production in the bone marrow. Severity can range from mild to life-threatening.

Hemolytic anemias: This group of anemias occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the bone marrow can replace them. Some forms are inherited, while others result from blood disorders.

Sickle cell anemia: An inherited type of hemolytic anemia where abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to form a crescent (sickle) shape. These cells break down prematurely, leading to a persistent shortage of red blood cells."
pancreatitis,"There are a number of factors that can cause pancreatitis. The most common causes are:

Gallstones (digestive fluids that become solid and form stones in the gallbladder)
Heavy alcohol use
Genetic disorders of the pancreas
Certain medicines

Other causes include:

Smoking
High levels of triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood)
High levels of parathyroid hormone in the blood (called hyperparathyroidism)
High levels of calcium in the blood (called hypercalcemia)
Cancer of the pancreas
Cystic fibrosis
A family history of pancreatitis
Abdominal surgery
Injury to the abdomen"
tuberculosis,"TB is caused by bacteria (germs) called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The germs spread from person to person through the air. People who have TB disease in their throat or lungs spread the germs in the air when they cough, sneeze, talk, or sing. If you breathe in the air that has the germs, you can get TB.

TB is not spread by touching, kissing, or sharing food or dishes.

You're more likely to catch TB from people you live or work with than from people you see for shorter amounts of time.

Who is more likely to get infected with tuberculosis (TB) germs?
Anyone who is near a person with TB disease can get infected with the germs. You are more likely to be near someone with TB disease if you:

Were born in or often travel to countries where TB disease is common
Are a health care worker
Work or live in a place where TB is more common, such as shelters for people without homes, jails, and nursing homes
Who is more likely to develop TB disease?
Certain people are more likely to get sick with TB disease after they get infected. They include people who:

Have HIV
Became infected with TB in the last 2 years
Have other diseases, such as diabetes, that make it hard for your body to fight TB germs
Have alcohol use disorder (AUD) or inject illegal drugs
Were not treated correctly for TB in the past
Are under age 5
Are an older adult
Take medicines that weaken the immune system, such as medicines taken after an organ transplant, steroids, and specialized treatments for certain autoimmune diseases"
chickenpox,"Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is a member of the herpesvirus family. The same virus also causes shingles in adults.

Chickenpox can be spread very easily to others from 1 to 2 days before blisters appear until all the blisters have crusted over. You may get chickenpox:

From touching the fluids from a chickenpox blister
If someone with the disease coughs or sneezes near you
Most cases of chickenpox occur in children younger than age 10. The disease is most often mild, although serious complications may occur. Adults and older children get sicker than younger children in most cases.

Children whose mothers have had chickenpox or have received the chickenpox vaccine are not very likely to catch it before they are 1 year old. If they do catch chickenpox, they often have mild cases. This is because antibodies from their mothers' blood help protect them. Children under 1 year old whose mothers have not had chickenpox or the vaccine can get severe chickenpox.

Severe chickenpox symptoms are more common in children whose immune system does not work well."
mumps,"Mumps is caused by a virus. The virus spreads from person to person by drops of moisture from the nose and mouth, such as through sneezing. It is also spread through direct contact with items that have infected saliva on them.

Mumps most often occurs in children ages 2 through 12 who have not been vaccinated against the disease. However, the infection can occur at any age and may also be seen in college age students.

The time between being exposed to the virus and getting sick (incubation period) is about 12 to 25 days."
tetanus,"Spores of the bacterium C tetani are found in the soil, and in animal feces and mouth (gastrointestinal tract). In the spore form, C tetani can remain inactive in the soil. But it can remain infectious for more than 40 years.

You can get tetanus infection when the spores enter your body through an injury or wound. The spores become active bacteria that spread in the body and make a poison called tetanus toxin (also known as tetanospasmin). This poison blocks nerve signals from your spinal cord to your muscles, causing severe muscle spasms. The spasms can be so powerful that they tear the muscles or cause fractures of the spine.

The time between infection and the first sign of symptoms is about 7 to 21 days. Nearly all cases of tetanus in the United States occur in those who have not been vaccinated against the disease.
"
polio,"Polio is a disease caused by infection with the poliovirus. The virus spreads by:

Direct person-to-person contact
Contact with infected mucus or phlegm from the nose or mouth
Contact with infected feces
The virus enters through the mouth and nose, multiplies in the throat and intestinal tract, and then is absorbed and spread through the blood and lymph system. The time from being infected with the virus to developing symptoms of disease (incubation) ranges from 5 to 35 days (average 7 to 14 days). Most people do not develop symptoms.

Risks factors include:

Lack of immunization against polio
Travel to an area that has had a polio outbreak
As a result of a global vaccination campaign over the past 25 years, polio has largely been eliminated. The disease still exists in some countries (such as Pakistan and Afghanistan), with outbreaks occurring in groups of people who have not been vaccinated."
lupus,"The cause of lupus is unknown. Researchers are studying what might cause or trigger the disease, such as:

Genetics
Environmental factors, such as viral infections, sunlight, certain medicines, and smoking
Problems with the immune system"
hemophilia,"Variants in the F8 gene cause hemophilia A, while variants in the F9 gene cause hemophilia B. The F8 gene provides instructions for making a protein called coagulation factor VIII. A related protein, coagulation factor IX, is produced from the F9 gene. Coagulation factors are proteins that work together in the blood clotting process. After an injury, blood clots protect the body by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing excessive blood loss.

Variants in the F8 or F9 gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII or coagulation factor IX, or reduce the amount of one of these proteins. The altered or missing protein cannot participate effectively in the blood clotting process. As a result, blood clots cannot form properly in response to injury. These problems with blood clotting lead to continuous bleeding that can be difficult to control. The variants that cause severe hemophilia almost completely eliminate the activity of coagulation factor VIII or coagulation factor IX. The variants involved in mild and moderate hemophilia reduce but do not eliminate the activity of one of these proteins.

Another form of the disorder, known as acquired hemophilia, is not caused by inherited gene variants. This rare condition is characterized by abnormal bleeding into the skin, muscles, or other soft tissues, usually beginning in adulthood. Acquired hemophilia results when the body makes specialized proteins called autoantibodies that attack and disable coagulation factor VIII. The production of autoantibodies is sometimes associated with pregnancy, immune system disorders, cancer, or allergic reactions to certain drugs. In about half of cases, the cause of acquired hemophilia is unknown."
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS),"Scientists have been researching chronic fatigue syndrome for many years, but they still don't know for sure what causes it.

Many doctors believe that the way some conditions interact within the body and mind might leave some people at risk for CFS. For example, if someone has a virus and is under a lot of stress, the combination of these two things might make them more likely to develop CFS.

These things are believed to interact with each other in this way, putting some people at risk for CFS:

infections. Experts have wondered if infections like measles or Epstein-Barr virus (the virus that causes mono) might increase the risk for CFS. The role Epstein-Barr plays in CFS is not clear because studies have not confirmed it as a cause.
problems with the immune system or the nervous system
hormone imbalances
emotional stress
low blood pressure
Chronic fatigue syndrome can affect people of all ethnicities and ages, but it's most common in people in their forties or fifties. It's very rare in kids. A few teens do get CFS, and it affects more girls than guys.

Sometimes different people in the same family get CFS. This might be because the tendency to develop CFS is genetic, but more research is needed to see if this is true."
