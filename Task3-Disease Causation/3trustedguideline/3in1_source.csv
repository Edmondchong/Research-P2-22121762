diabetes,MayoClinic,"To understand diabetes, it's important to understand how the body normally uses glucose.

How insulin works:
Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland behind and below the stomach (pancreas).

The pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream.
The insulin circulates, letting sugar enter the cells.
Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream.
As the blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from the pancreas.

The role of glucose:
Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.

Glucose comes from two major sources: food and the liver.
Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.
The liver stores and makes glucose.
When glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose. This keeps your glucose level within a typical range.

The exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown. In all cases, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. This is because the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of genetic or environmental factors. It is unclear what those factors may be."
diabetes,MedlinePlus,"The different types of diabetes have different causes:

Researchers think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and factors in the environment that might trigger the disease.
Type 2 diabetes is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes. The lifestyle factors include not being physically active and being overweight or having obesity.
Researchers think gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors."
diabetes,Healthline,"Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes
Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.

Genes may play a role in some people. It’s also possible that a virus sets off an immune system attack.

Type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Having overweight or obesity increases your risk, too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar.

This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.

Type 1.5 diabetes
Type 1.5 is an autoimmune condition that occurs when the pancreas is attacked by your own antibodies. as in type 1. It may be genetic, but more research is needed.

Gestational diabetes
Gestational diabetes occurs as the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant person’s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy.

People who are overweight when they get pregnant or who gain too much weight during pregnancy are more likely to get gestational diabetes."
pneumonia,MayoClinic,"Many germs can cause pneumonia. The most common are bacteria and viruses in the air we breathe. Your body usually prevents these germs from infecting your lungs. But sometimes these germs can overpower your immune system, even if your health is generally good.

Pneumonia is classified according to the types of germs that cause it and where you got the infection.

Community-acquired pneumonia:
Community-acquired pneumonia is the most common type of pneumonia. It occurs outside of hospitals or other health care facilities. It may be caused by:

- Bacteria. The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the U.S. is Streptococcus pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur on its own or after you've had a cold or the flu. It may affect one part (lobe) of the lung, a condition called lobar pneumonia.
- Bacteria-like organisms. Mycoplasma pneumoniae also can cause pneumonia. It typically produces milder symptoms than do other types of pneumonia. Walking pneumonia is an informal name given to this type of pneumonia, which typically isn't severe enough to require bed rest.
- Fungi. This type of pneumonia is most common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems, and in people who have inhaled large doses of the organisms. The fungi that cause it can be found in soil or bird droppings and vary depending upon geographic location.
- Viruses, including COVID-19. Some of the viruses that cause colds and the flu can cause pneumonia. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years. Viral pneumonia is usually mild. But in some cases it can become very serious. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may cause pneumonia, which can become severe.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia
Some people catch pneumonia during a hospital stay for another illness. Hospital-acquired pneumonia can be serious because the bacteria causing it may be more resistant to antibiotics and because the people who get it are already sick. People who are on breathing machines (ventilators), often used in intensive care units, are at higher risk of this type of pneumonia.

Health care-acquired pneumonia
Health care-acquired pneumonia is a bacterial infection that occurs in people who live in long-term care facilities or who receive care in outpatient clinics, including kidney dialysis centers. Like hospital-acquired pneumonia, health care-acquired pneumonia can be caused by bacteria that are more resistant to antibiotics.

Aspiration pneumonia
Aspiration pneumonia occurs when you inhale food, drink, vomit or saliva into your lungs. Aspiration is more likely if something disturbs your normal gag reflex, such as a brain injury or swallowing problem, or excessive use of alcohol or drugs."
pneumonia,MedlinePlus,"Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections can cause pneumonia.

Bacteria are the most common cause. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own. It can also develop after you've had certain viral infections such as a cold or the flu. Several different types of bacteria can cause pneumonia, including:

Streptococcus pneumoniae
Legionella pneumophila; this type of pneumonia is often called Legionnaires' disease
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Chlamydia pneumoniae
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)

Viruses that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is often mild and goes away on its own within a few weeks. But sometimes it is serious enough that you need to get treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you are at risk of also getting bacterial pneumonia. The different viruses that can cause pneumonia include:

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
Some common cold and flu viruses
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19

Fungal pneumonia is more common in people who have chronic health problems or weakened immune systems. Some of the types include:

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)
Valley fever (Coccidioidomycosis)
Histoplasmosis
Cryptococcal pneumonia

Aspiration can also cause pneumonia. It can happen when you aspirate (accidentally breathe in) food or fluid into the lungs. If you are not able to cough out the food or fluid, it may cause an infection."
pneumonia,Healthline,"Pneumonia happens when germs get into your lungs and cause an infection. The immune system’s reaction to clear the infection results in inflammation of the lung’s air sacs (alveoli). This inflammation can eventually cause the air sacs to fill up with pus and liquids, causing pneumonia symptoms.

Several types of infectious agents can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

Bacterial pneumonia
The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other causes include:

Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Haemophilus influenzae
Legionella pneumophila

Viral pneumonia
Respiratory viruses are often the cause of pneumonia. Examples of viral infections that can cause pneumonia include:

influenza (flu)
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
rhinoviruses (common cold)
human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection
human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection
measles
chickenpox (varicella-zoster virus)
adenovirus infection
coronavirus infection
SARS-CoV-2 infection (the virus that causes COVID-19)

Although the symptoms of viral and bacterial pneumonia are very similar, viral pneumonia is usually milder. It can improve in 1 to 3 weeks without treatment.

According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood InstituteTrusted Source, people with viral pneumonia are at risk of developing bacterial pneumonia.

Fungal pneumonia
Fungi from soil or bird droppings can cause pneumonia. They most often cause pneumonia in people with weakened immune systems. Examples of fungi that can cause pneumonia include:

Pneumocystis jirovecii
Cryptococcus species
Histoplasmosis species
Coccidioides species"
asthma,MayoClinic,"It isn't clear why some people get asthma and others don't, but it's probably due to a combination of environmental and inherited (genetic) factors.

Asthma triggers
Exposure to various irritants and substances that trigger allergies (allergens) can trigger signs and symptoms of asthma. Asthma triggers are different from person to person and can include:

Airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander or particles of cockroach waste
Respiratory infections, such as the common cold
Physical activity
Cold air
Air pollutants and irritants, such as smoke
Certain medications, including beta blockers, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve)
Strong emotions and stress
Sulfites and preservatives added to some types of foods and beverages, including shrimp, dried fruit, processed potatoes, beer and wine
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat"
asthma,MedlinePlus,"The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics and your environment likely play a role in who gets asthma.

An asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma:

Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include
Dust mites
Mold
Pets
Pollen from grass, trees, and weeds
Waste from pests such as cockroaches and mice

Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as
Breathing in cold air
Certain medicines
Household chemicals
Infections such as colds and the flu
Outdoor air pollution
Tobacco smoke

Occupational asthma is caused by breathing in chemicals or industrial dusts at work
Exercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry

Asthma triggers may be different for each person and can change over time."
asthma,Healthline,"Although asthma is especially common in children, many people don’t develop asthma until adulthood.

Health experts have not identified a specific cause of asthma. Instead, researchers believe it’s caused by a variety of factors, including:

-Genetics: If your parent or sibling has asthma, you’re more likely to develop it.
-History of viral infections: People with a history of severe viral infections during childhood, such as respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV), may be more likely to develop asthma.
-Hygiene hypothesis: When babies are not exposed to enough bacteria in their early months and years, their immune systems may not become strong enough to fight off asthma and other allergic conditions.

Many factors can also trigger asthma, causing the symptoms to worsen. Triggers for asthma can vary, and some people may be more sensitive to certain triggers than others.

The most common triggers include:

health conditions such as respiratory infections
exercise
environmental irritants
allergens
intense emotions
extreme weather conditions
pests
certain medications, including aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)"
gout,MayoClinic,"Gout occurs when urate crystals accumulate in your joint, causing the inflammation and intense pain of a gout attack. Urate crystals can form when you have high levels of uric acid in your blood. Your body produces uric acid when it breaks down purines — substances that are found naturally in your body.

Purines are also found in certain foods, including red meat and organ meats, such as liver. Purine-rich seafood includes anchovies, sardines, mussels, scallops, trout and tuna. Alcoholic beverages, especially beer, and drinks sweetened with fruit sugar (fructose) promote higher levels of uric acid.

Normally, uric acid dissolves in your blood and passes through your kidneys into your urine. But sometimes either your body produces too much uric acid or your kidneys excrete too little uric acid. When this happens, uric acid can build up, forming sharp, needlelike urate crystals in a joint or surrounding tissue that cause pain, inflammation and swelling."
gout,MedlinePlus,"Gout happens when too much uric acid (urate) builds up in your body over a long time. Uric acid is a waste product your body makes when it breaks down purines. Purines are substances that are in your body's tissues and in many foods.

When your body breaks down old cells or digests foods that contain purine, most of the uric acid that's made dissolves in your blood. Your kidneys filter the uric acid out of your blood, and it leaves your body in your urine (pee).

However, sometimes your body can make too much uric acid or does not remove enough of it. Then the uric acid levels build up in your body, including in your blood. Having too much uric acid in the blood is called hyperuricemia. It does not cause health problems for everyone. But in some people, uric acid forms needle-like crystals. They can form in your joints, which causes gout. The crystals can also cause kidney stones.

Calcium pyrophosphate arthritis, sometimes called pseudogout, is a related disease. It causes similar symptoms and is sometimes confused with gout. But it is caused by a buildup of calcium phosphate, not uric acid."
gout,Healthline,"The buildup of uric acid in your blood from the breakdown of purines causes gout.

Certain conditions, such as blood and metabolism disorders or dehydration, make your body produce too much uric acid.

A kidney or thyroid problem, or an inherited disorder, can make it harder for your body to remove excess uric acid.

You’re more likely to get gout if you:

are a middle-aged man or postmenopausal woman
have parents, siblings, or other family members with gout
drink alcohol
take medications such as diuretics and cyclosporine
have a condition like high blood pressure, kidney disease, thyroid disease, diabetes, or sleep apnea
For some people, gout is caused by consuming foods that are high in gout-producing purines."
malaria,MayoClinic,"Malaria is caused by a single-celled parasite of the genus plasmodium. The parasite is transmitted to humans most commonly through mosquito bites.

Mosquito transmission cycle:
Malaria spreads when a mosquito becomes infected with the disease after biting an infected person, and the infected mosquito then bites a noninfected person. The malaria parasites enter that person's bloodstream and travel to the liver. When the parasites mature, they leave the liver and infect red blood cells.

-Uninfected mosquito. A mosquito becomes infected by feeding on a person who has malaria.
-Transmission of parasite. If this mosquito bites you in the future, it can transmit malaria parasites to you.
-In the liver. Once the parasites enter your body, they travel to your liver — where some types can lie dormant for as long as a year.
-Into the bloodstream. When the parasites mature, they leave the liver and infect your red blood cells. This is when people typically develop malaria symptoms.
-On to the next person. If an uninfected mosquito bites you at this point in the cycle, it will become infected with your malaria parasites and can spread them to the other people it bites.

Other modes of transmission
Because the parasites that cause malaria affect red blood cells, people can also catch malaria from exposure to infected blood, including:

From mother to unborn child
Through blood transfusions
By sharing needles used to inject drugs"
malaria,MedlinePlus,"Malaria is caused by a parasite. It is passed to humans by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. After infection, the parasites (called sporozoites) travel through the bloodstream to the liver. There, they mature and release another form of parasites, called merozoites. The parasites enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells (RBCs).

The parasites multiply inside the red blood cells. The cells then break open within 48 to 72 hours and infect more red blood cells. The first symptoms usually occur 2 to 4 weeks after infection, though they can appear as early as 8 days or as long as a year after infection. The symptoms occur in cycles of 48 to 72 hours.

Most symptoms are caused by:

The release of merozoites into the bloodstream
Anemia resulting from the destruction of the red blood cells
Large amounts of free hemoglobin being released into circulation after red blood cells break open, which can damage other organs such as the kidneys
Malaria can also be transmitted from a mother to her unborn baby (congenitally) and by blood transfusions. Malaria can be carried by mosquitoes in temperate climates, but the parasite disappears over the winter.

The disease is a major health problem in much of the tropics and subtropics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2020 there were about 241 million cases of malaria. About 627,000 people died of it. Malaria is a major disease hazard for travelers to warm climates.

In some areas of the world, mosquitoes that carry malaria have developed resistance to insecticides. In addition, the parasites have developed resistance to some antibiotics. These conditions have made it hard to control both the rate of infection and spread of this disease."
malaria,Healthline,"Malaria can occur if a mosquito infected with the Plasmodium parasite bites you. There are four kinds of malaria parasites that can infect humans: Plasmodium vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. falciparum.

P. falciparum causes a more severe form of the disease and those who contract this form of malaria have a higher risk of death. An infected mother can also pass the disease to her baby at birth. This is known as congenital malaria.

Malaria is transmitted by blood, so it can also be transmitted through:

an organ transplant
a transfusion
use of shared needles or syringes"
migraine,MayoClinic,"Though migraine causes aren't fully understood, genetics and environmental factors appear to play a role.

Changes in the brainstem and its interactions with the trigeminal nerve, a major pain pathway, might be involved. So might imbalances in brain chemicals — including serotonin, which helps regulate pain in your nervous system.

Researchers are studying the role of serotonin in migraines. Other neurotransmitters play a role in the pain of migraine, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).

Migraine triggers
There are a number of migraine triggers, including:

Hormonal changes in women. Fluctuations in estrogen, such as before or during menstrual periods, pregnancy and menopause, seem to trigger headaches in many women.

Hormonal medications, such as oral contraceptives, also can worsen migraines. Some women, however, find that their migraines occur less often when taking these medications.

Drinks. These include alcohol, especially wine, and too much caffeine, such as coffee.
Stress. Stress at work or home can cause migraines.
Sensory stimuli. Bright or flashing lights can induce migraines, as can loud sounds. Strong smells — such as perfume, paint thinner, secondhand smoke and others — trigger migraines in some people.
Sleep changes. Missing sleep or getting too much sleep can trigger migraines in some people.
Physical strain. Intense physical exertion, including sexual activity, might provoke migraines.
Weather changes. A change of weather or barometric pressure can prompt a migraine.
Medications. Oral contraceptives and vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin, can aggravate migraines.
Foods. Aged cheeses and salty and processed foods might trigger migraines. So might skipping meals.
Food additives. These include the sweetener aspartame and the preservative monosodium glutamate (MSG), found in many foods."
migraine,MedlinePlus,"Researchers believe that migraine has a genetic cause. There are also a number of factors that can trigger a migraine. These factors vary from person to person, and they include:

Stress
Anxiety
Hormonal changes in women
Bright or flashing lights
Loud noises
Strong smells
Medicines
Too much or not enough sleep
Sudden changes in weather or environment
Overexertion (too much physical activity)
Tobacco
Caffeine or caffeine withdrawal
Skipped meals
Medication overuse (taking medicine for migraines too often)
Some people have found that certain foods or ingredients can trigger headaches, especially when they are combined with other triggers. These foods and ingredients include:

Alcohol
Chocolate
Aged cheeses
Monosodium glutamate (MSG)
Some fruits and nuts
Fermented or pickled goods
Yeast
Cured or processed meats"
migraine,Healthline,"Researchers haven’t identified a definitive cause for migraine. But experts believe a combination of genetics, hormones, and irregular brain activity all play a role. These factors likely contribute to affecting nerve signaling, chemicals, and blood vessels in the brain.

What can trigger a migraine attack?
More than three-quarters of people with migraine report that something triggers their migraine attacks. These could be things in their diet, changes in their environment, or other events.

While migraine triggers can be very personal, commonly reported triggers include:

bright lights
severe heat, or other extremes in weather
dehydration
changes in barometric pressure
hormone changes in people assigned female at birth, like estrogen and progesterone fluctuations during menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause
excess stress
loud sounds
intense physical activity
skipping meals
changes in sleep patterns
use of certain medications, like oral contraceptives or nitroglycerin
unusual smells
certain foods
smoking
alcohol use
traveling

If you experience a migraine attack, a doctor may ask you to keep a headache journal. Writing down what you were doing, what foods you ate, and what medications you took before your migraine attack began can help identify your triggers."
appendicitis,MayoClinic,"A blockage in the lining of the appendix, called the lumen, is the likely cause of appendicitis. This blockage can cause an infection. The bacteria then multiply quickly, causing the appendix to become inflamed, swollen and filled with pus. If not treated right away, the appendix may burst or break open."
appendicitis,MedlinePlus,"Appendicitis is a very common reason for emergency surgery. The problem most often occurs when the appendix becomes blocked by feces, a foreign object, a tumor or a parasite in rare cases."
appendicitis,Healthline,"In many cases, the exact cause of appendicitis is unknown. Experts believe it develops when part of the appendix becomes obstructed or blocked.

Many things can potentially blockTrusted Source your appendix, including:

a buildup of hardened stool
enlarged lymphoid follicles
intestinal worms
traumatic injury
tumors"
diarrhea,MayoClinic,"A number of diseases and conditions can cause diarrhea, including:

Viruses. Viruses that can cause diarrhea include Norwalk virus, also known as norovirus, enteric adenoviruses, astrovirus, cytomegalovirus and viruses that cause hepatitis. Rotavirus is a common cause of sudden childhood diarrhea. The virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also has been linked to gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
Bacteria and parasites. Exposure to certain bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, or parasites through contaminated food or water can lead to diarrhea. When traveling in developing countries, diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites is often called traveler's diarrhea. Clostridioides difficile, also known as C. diff, is another bacterium that causes diarrhea, and it can occur after a course of antibiotics or during a hospital stay.
Medicines. Many medicines, such as antibiotics, can cause diarrhea. Antibiotics get rid of infections by killing bacteria that cause illness, but they also kill good bacteria that are helpful in the body. This disturbs the natural balance of bacteria in the intestines, leading to diarrhea or an infection such as C. diff. Other medicines that cause diarrhea are anticancer drugs and antacids with magnesium.
Lactose intolerance. Lactose is a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. People who have trouble digesting lactose often have diarrhea after eating dairy products. Lactose intolerance can increase with age because levels of the enzyme that helps digest lactose become lower as people get older.
Fructose. Fructose is a sugar found naturally in fruits and honey. It's sometimes added as a sweetener to certain beverages. Fructose can lead to diarrhea in people who have trouble digesting it.
Artificial sweeteners. Sorbitol, erythritol and mannitol — nonabsorbable sugars used as artificial sweeteners in chewing gum and other sugar-free products — can cause diarrhea in some otherwise healthy people.
Surgery. Partial intestine or gallbladder removal surgeries can sometimes cause diarrhea.
Other digestive disorders. Chronic diarrhea has a number of other causes, such as IBS, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, microscopic colitis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)."
diarrhea,MedlinePlus,"The most common causes of diarrhea include:

Bacteria from contaminated food or water
Viruses such as the flu, norovirus, or rotavirus . Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea in children.
Parasites, which are tiny organisms found in contaminated food or water
Medicines such as antibiotics, cancer drugs, and antacids that contain magnesium
Food intolerances and sensitivities, which are problems digesting certain ingredients or foods. An example is lactose intolerance.
Diseases that affect the stomach, small intestine, or colon, such as Crohn's disease
Problems with how the colon functions, such as irritable bowel syndrome

Some people also get diarrhea after stomach surgery, because sometimes the surgeries can cause food to move through your digestive system more quickly.

Sometimes no cause can be found. If your diarrhea goes away within a few days, finding the cause is usually not necessary."
diarrhea,Healthline,"You may experience diarrhea because of several conditions or circumstances. Potential causes of diarrhea include:

viral infections including rotavirus, norovirus, and viral gastroenteritis
bacterial infections, including Salmonella and E. coli
parasitic infections
intestinal diseases
a food intolerance, such as lactose intolerance
an adverse reaction to a medication
gallbladder or stomach surgery

Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea globally. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this infection causes around 40 percent of hospitalizations in children under 5 years old. Globally, most diarrhea deaths are the result of contaminated water supplies and insufficient sanitation.

In the United States, you are more likely to develop diarrhea due to food poisoning from eating contaminated foodstuffs. According to the CDC, annually there are close to 48 million diarrheal illnesses caused by contaminated food in the United States.

Chronic diarrhea may be a symptom of a more severe condition such as irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease. Frequent and severe diarrhea could be a sign of intestinal disease or a functional bowel disorder."
endometriosis,MayoClinic,"The exact cause of endometriosis isn't clear. But some possible causes include:

Retrograde menstruation. This is when menstrual blood flows back through the fallopian tubes and into the pelvic cavity instead of out of the body. The blood contains endometrial cells from the inner lining of the uterus. These cells may stick to the pelvic walls and surfaces of pelvic organs. There, they might grow and continue to thicken and bleed over the course of each menstrual cycle.
Transformed peritoneal cells. Experts suggest that hormones or immune factors might help transform cells that line the inner side of the abdomen, called peritoneal cells, into cells that are like those that line the inside of the uterus.
Embryonic cell changes. Hormones such as estrogen may transform embryonic cells — cells in the earliest stages of development — into endometrial-like cell growths during puberty.
Surgical scar complication. Endometrial cells may attach to scar tissue from a cut made during surgery to the stomach area, such as a C-section.
Endometrial cell transport. The blood vessels or tissue fluid system may move endometrial cells to other parts of the body.
Immune system condition. A problem with the immune system may make the body unable to recognize and destroy endometriosis tissue."
endometriosis,MedlinePlus,"Every month, a woman's ovaries produce hormones that tell the cells lining the uterus to swell and get thicker. Your uterus sheds these cells along with blood and tissue through your vagina when you have your period.

Endometriosis occurs when these cells grow outside the uterus in other parts of your body. This tissue may attach on your:

Ovaries
Fallopian tubes
Bowel
Rectum
Bladder
Lining of your pelvic area

It can grow in other areas of the body, too.

These growths stay in your body, and like the cells in the lining of your uterus, these growths react to the hormones from your ovaries. This may cause you to have pain during the month prior to the onset of your period. Over time, the growths may add more tissue and blood. Growths can also build up in the abdomen and pelvis, leading to chronic pelvic pain, heavy cycles, and infertility.

The cause of endometriosis is unknown. One idea is that when you get your period, the cells may travel backwards through the fallopian tubes into the pelvis. Once there, the cells attach and grow. However, this backward period flow occurs in many women. The immune system may play a role in causing endometriosis in women with the condition.

Endometriosis is common. It occurs in about 10% of women of reproductive age. Sometimes, it may run in families. Endometriosis probably starts when a woman begins having periods. However, it usually is not diagnosed until ages 25 to 35.

You are more likely to develop endometriosis if you:

Have a mother or sister with endometriosis
Started your period at a young age
Never had children
Have frequent periods, or they last 7 or more days"
endometriosis,Healthline,"During a regular menstrual cycle, your body sheds the lining of your uterus. This allows menstrual blood to flow from your uterus through the small opening in the cervix and out through your vagina.

The exact cause of endometriosis isn’t known. There are severa theories regarding the cause, although no one theory has been scientifically proven.

One of the oldest theories is that endometriosis occurs due to a process called retrograde menstruation, which 90 percent of women experience, according to research. This happens when menstrual blood flows back through your fallopian tubes into your pelvic cavity instead of leaving your body through the vagina.

Another theory is that hormones transform the cells outside the uterus into cells similar to those lining the inside of the uterus, which are known as endometrial cells.

Others believe the condition may occur if small areas of your abdomen convert into endometrial-like tissue. This may happen because cells in your abdomen grow from embryonic cells, which can change shape and act like endometrial cells. It’s not known why this occurs.

These displaced endometrial cells may be on your pelvic walls and the surfaces of your pelvic organs, such as your bladder, ovaries, and rectum. They continue to grow, thicken, and bleed over the course of your menstrual cycle in response to the hormones of your cycle.

It’s also possible for the menstrual blood to leak into the pelvic cavity through a surgical scar, such as after a cesarean delivery, also commonly called a C-section.

Another theory is that the endometrial cells are transported out of the uterus through the lymphatic system. Still another theory purports it may be due to the immune system not working properly in destroying errant endometrial cells.

Some believe endometriosis might start in the fetal period with misplaced cell tissue that begins to respond to the hormones of puberty. This is often called Mullerian theory.

The development of endometriosis might also be linked to genetics or even environmental toxins."
epilepsy,MayoClinic,"Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including:

Genetic influence. Some types of epilepsy run in families. In these instances, it's likely that there's a genetic influence. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes. But some people have genetic epilepsy that isn't hereditary. Genetic changes can occur in a child without being passed down from a parent.

For most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures.

Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy.
Factors in the brain. Brain tumors can cause epilepsy. Epilepsy also may be caused by the way blood vessels form in the brain. People with blood vessel conditions such as arteriovenous malformations and cavernous malformations can have seizures. And in adults older than age 35, stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy.
Infections. Meningitis, HIV, viral encephalitis and some parasitic infections can cause epilepsy.
Injury before birth. Before they're born, babies are sensitive to brain damage that could be caused by several factors. They might include an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or not enough oxygen. This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy.
Developmental conditions. Epilepsy can sometimes occur with developmental conditions. People with autism are more likely to have epilepsy than are people without autism. Research also has found that people with epilepsy are more likely to have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other developmental conditions. Having both conditions may be related to genes."
epilepsy,MedlinePlus,"Epilepsy has many possible causes, including illness, brain injury, and abnormal brain development. In many cases, the cause is unknown."
epilepsy,Healthline,"In about half of people with epilepsy, the cause cannot be determined, per the WHO. A variety of factors can contribute to the development of seizures, such as:

traumatic brain injury or other head trauma
brain scarring after a brain injury (post-traumatic epilepsy)
serious illness or very high fever
stroke, which causes about half of epilepsy cases in older adults when there’s no identifiable cause, according to the CDC
lack of oxygen to the brain
brain tumor or cyst
dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease
maternal use of some drugs, prenatal injury, brain malformation, or lack of oxygen at birth
infectious conditions like HIV and AIDS and meningitis
genetic or developmental disorders or neurological diseases"
fever,MayoClinic,"Typical body temperature is a balance of heat production and heat loss. An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs) — also known as your body's ""thermostat"" — monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.

When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.

Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.

Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:

A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis — inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine"
fever,MedlinePlus,"A fever is a body temperature that is higher than normal. A normal temperature can vary from person to person, but it is usually around 98.6 °F (37 °C). A fever is not a disease. It is usually a sign that your body is trying to fight an illness or infection.

Infections cause most fevers. You get a fever because your body is trying to kill the virus or bacteria that caused the infection. Most of those bacteria and viruses do well when your body is at your normal temperature. But if you have a fever, it is harder for them to survive. Fever also activates your body's immune system.

Other causes of fevers include:

Medicines, including some antibiotics, blood pressure medicines, and anti-seizure medicines
Heat illness
Cancers

fever,Healthline,"Fever occurs when a part of the brain called the hypothalamus shifts the set point of your normal body temperature upward. When this happens, you may feel chilled and add layers of clothing, or you may start shivering to generate more body heat. This eventually results in a higher body temperature.

There are numerous different conditions that can trigger a fever. Some possible causes include:

infections, including the flu and pneumonia
some immunizations, such as diphtheria or tetanus (in children)
teething (in infants)
some inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn’s disease
blood clots
extreme sunburn
food poisoning
some medications, including antibiotics
Depending on the cause of the fever, additional symptoms may include:

sweating
shivering
headache
muscle aches
loss of appetite
dehydration
general weakness"
fibromyalgia,MayoClinic,"Many researchers believe that repeated nerve stimulation causes the brain and spinal cord of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain.

In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become sensitized, meaning they can overreact to painful and nonpainful signals.

There are likely many factors that lead to these changes, including:

Genetics. Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder.
Infections. Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia.
Physical or emotional events. Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical event, such as a car accident. Prolonged psychological stress may also trigger the condition."
fibromyalgia,MedlinePlus,"Fibromyalgia is known to run in families, suggesting that genetic factors contribute to the risk of developing this disease. However, little is known for certain about the genetic basis of fibromyalgia. It is likely that variations in many genes, each with a small effect, combine to increase the risk of developing this condition.

The signs and symptoms of fibromyalgia are related to the way the brain recognizes and interprets pain signals. People with fibromyalgia have an increased sensitivity to pain; they feel pain more acutely than others would in response to a given stimulus. Researchers describe this phenomenon as the ""volume"" of pain sensations being turned up too high (pain amplification). Studies of the genetics of fibromyalgia have focused on genes with roles in the way the brain processes pain. For example, several genes that may influence the condition are involved in the production and breakdown of certain chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. These chemicals relay signals between nerve cells that can increase or decrease the sensation of pain, a process known as pain modulation.

Nongenetic (environmental) factors also play critical roles in a person's risk of developing fibromyalgia. The disorder can be triggered by infection or illness that would not otherwise cause chronic pain, injury, and other physical stress. Psychological and social factors such as a history of childhood abuse or neglect, exposure to war or other catastrophic events, and low job or life satisfaction have also been associated with an increased risk of fibromyalgia. Additionally, physical inactivity, obesity, and sleep disturbances seem to increase risk. However, many people who develop this condition do not have any recognized triggers or risk factors. It is likely that environmental conditions interact with genetic factors to determine the overall risk of developing this disorder."
fibromyalgia,Healthline,"Healthcare professionals and researchers do not know what causes fibromyalgia.

According to the latest research, the cause appears to involve a genetic disposition complemented by one or more triggers (such as infection, trauma, or stress).

Experts do not fully understand what causes the chronic widespread nature of fibromyalgia pain, either.

One theory is that the brain lowers the pain threshold. Sensations that were not painful before become very painful over time.

Another theory is that the brain and nerves may misinterpret or overreact to normal pain signals. They become more sensitive, to the point where they cause unnecessary or exaggerated pain. This may be due to a chemical imbalance in the brain or an abnormality in the dorsal root ganglion, which is a cluster of neurons in the spine.

Genes
Fibromyalgia often runs in families. If you have a family member with this condition, you’re at a higher risk for developing it.

Researchers think certain gene mutations may play a role. They’ve identified a few possible genes that affect the transmission of chemical pain signals between nerve cells.

Infections
A past illness could trigger fibromyalgia or make its symptoms worse. Infections that have possible links to fibromyalgia include:

flu
pneumonia
Epstein-Barr virus
gastrointestinal infections, such as those caused by the bacteria Salmonella and Shigella
Trauma
People who go through severe physical or emotional trauma may develop fibromyalgia. The condition has been linked to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Stress
Like trauma, stress can have long-lasting effects on your body. Stress has been linked to hormonal changes that could contribute to fibromyalgia."
gallstones,MayoClinic,"It's not clear what causes gallstones to form. Doctors think gallstones may result when:

Your bile contains too much cholesterol. Normally, your bile contains enough chemicals to dissolve the cholesterol excreted by your liver. But if your liver excretes more cholesterol than your bile can dissolve, the excess cholesterol may form into crystals and eventually into stones.
Your bile contains too much bilirubin. Bilirubin is a chemical that's produced when your body breaks down red blood cells. Certain conditions cause your liver to make too much bilirubin, including liver cirrhosis, biliary tract infections and certain blood disorders. The excess bilirubin contributes to gallstone formation.
Your gallbladder doesn't empty correctly. If your gallbladder doesn't empty completely or often enough, bile may become very concentrated, contributing to the formation of gallstones."
gallstones,MedlinePlus,"The cause of gallstones varies. There are two main types of gallstones:

Stones made of cholesterol -- This is the most common type. Cholesterol gallstones are not related to cholesterol level in the blood. In most cases, they are not visible on CT scans but are visible on a sonogram (ultrasound) of the abdomen.
Stones made of bilirubin -- These are called pigment stones. They occur when red blood cells are destroyed and too much bilirubin is in the bile."
gallstones,Healthline,"The cause of gallstones is thought to be due to having too much cholesterol or bilirubin in your gallbladder.

Cholesterol: Too much cholesterol in your bile can lead to yellow cholesterol stones, which may develop if your liver makes more cholesterol than your bile can dissolve. Approximately 4 in 5 gallstones are made from cholesterol.
Bilirubin: This chemical is produced during the normal breakdown of red blood cells. After bilirubin is created, it passes through the liver and is excreted out of the body. These hard stones are often dark brown or black and form when your gallbladder can’t break down the excess bilirubin.
Gallstones may also happen if your gallbladder fails to properly empty its bile content. This bile can become overly concentrated, causing stones to form.

Gallbladder symptoms can sometimes happen after eating high fat foods, too."
GERD,MayoClinic,"GERD, or gastroesophageal reflux disease, is a condition commonly associated with acid reflux, which occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) does not function properly.

The LES is a circular muscle at the bottom of the esophagus that opens to allow food and liquids to pass into the stomach and closes to prevent backflow. When the LES weakens or fails to close correctly, stomach contents, including digestive acids, can flow back into the esophagus, causing discomfort and inflammation.

Factors Affecting LES Function
Several factors can interfere with the proper functioning of the LES, including:

Hiatal hernia: This occurs when part of the stomach moves above the diaphragm, weakening its ability to support the LES.
Overeating: Consuming large meals can stretch the stomach, reducing the pressure on the LES and allowing reflux.
Lying down after eating: This position can reduce the pressure needed for the LES to stay closed.
Additional Contributing Factors
Certain lifestyle habits and health conditions can increase the risk of GERD or worsen symptoms:

Lifestyle factors:

Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke
Eating large meals close to bedtime
Frequent use of NSAIDs like aspirin and ibuprofen
Health factors:

Obesity
Pregnancy
Connective tissue disorders
Aging
Other health conditions:

Anxiety
Asthma
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
Pregnancy
The Role of Alcohol
Research shows that alcohol can exacerbate GERD, with higher consumption levels linked to increased risk. Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake may help improve symptoms.

Dietary Triggers
Certain foods and beverages are more likely to provoke GERD symptoms, such as:

High-fat foods, including fried and fast foods
Spicy dishes
Acidic fruits and vegetables, like citrus, tomatoes, and pineapple
Drinks like coffee, tea, and carbonated beverages
Managing GERD typically involves lifestyle adjustments, such as avoiding trigger foods, maintaining a healthy weight, and reducing alcohol consumption, to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life."
GERD,MedlinePlus,"GERD, or gastroesophageal reflux disease, often leads to acid reflux due to dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

The LES is a ring of muscle located at the lower end of the esophagus. It relaxes to allow food and liquids to pass from the esophagus into the stomach and then tightens to prevent backflow. However, acid reflux occurs when the LES does not close properly, allowing stomach contents, including digestive juices, to flow back into the esophagus.

Factors Affecting LES Function
The LES may not work effectively due to:

Hiatal hernia: When part of the stomach pushes above the diaphragm, it can impair the LES's ability to close.
Large meals: Overeating can distend the stomach, reducing pressure on the LES and hindering its function.
Lying down soon after eating: This can decrease the pressure needed for the LES to function correctly.
Other Contributing Factors
Persistent reflux and esophageal inflammation may result from several lifestyle and health factors:

Lifestyle factors:

Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke
Consuming large meals before lying down
Excessive use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like aspirin or ibuprofen
Health factors:

Obesity
Pregnancy
Connective tissue disorders
Older age
Other health conditions:

Anxiety
Asthma
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
Pregnancy
Alcohol and GERD
Research indicates that alcohol consumption may increase GERD risk, with stronger correlations seen with higher quantities and frequency. Reducing or avoiding alcohol can help alleviate symptoms.

Dietary Triggers
Certain foods and beverages can aggravate GERD symptoms, such as:

High-fat foods like fried or fast foods
Spicy foods
Specific fruits and vegetables, including citrus, tomatoes, and pineapple
Beverages like coffee, tea, and carbonated drinks
If diagnosed with GERD, lifestyle adjustments, dietary changes, and limiting alcohol intake can help manage symptoms effectively."
GERD,Healthline,"GERD commonly causes acid reflux, which may result from improper functioning of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

The LES is a circular band of muscle at the end of your esophagus. When you swallow, it relaxes and opens up to allow food and liquid to travel from your mouth to your stomach. Then, it tightens and closes again.

Acid reflux happens when your LES doesn’t tighten or close properly. This allows digestive juices and other contents of your stomach to rise up into your esophagus.

Your LES may not function properly if you:

Have a hiatal hernia: This occurs when part of your stomach moves above your diaphragm toward your chest. If your diaphragm is compromised, it may prevent your LES from functioning properly.
Frequently eat large meals: This may cause distension of the upper part of your stomach. This distension sometimes means there isn’t enough pressure on the LES, and it doesn’t close properly.
Lie down too soon after meals: This might not create enough pressure for the LES to function properly.

Other factors, including those listed below, may also contribute to having heartburn more than twice a week.

Lifestyle factors
Lifestyle factors that may contribute to persistent reflux with esophageal inflammation include:

smoking or being exposed to secondhand smoke
eating large meals before lying down
using an abundance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen
Health factors
Health factors such as the following may contribute to GERD:

obesity
pregnancy
connective tissue disorders
older age

Other conditions
Other health conditions that can worsen the symptoms of GERD include:

anxiety
pregnancy
asthma
irritable bowel syndrome

Alcohol
Studies suggest that drinking alcohol may increase the risk of GERD. The greater the quantity of alcohol and frequency of consumption, the greater the correlation.

If you’ve received a diagnosis of GERD, limiting or stopping alcohol intake may provide symptom relief.

Dietary triggers
Some foods may trigger GERD symptoms more than others, including:

high fat foods such as fried and fast foods
spicy foods
certain fruits and vegetables, such as pineapple, tomato, and citrus
certain liquids, such as coffee, tea, and carbonated drinks"
heart attack,MayoClinic,"Coronary artery disease causes most heart attacks. In coronary artery disease, one or more of the heart (coronary) arteries are blocked. This is usually due to cholesterol-containing deposits called plaques. Plaques can narrow the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart.

If a plaque breaks open, it can cause a blood clot in the heart.

A heart attack may be caused by a complete or partial blockage of a heart (coronary) artery. One way to classify heart attacks is whether an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) shows some specific changes (ST elevation) that require emergency invasive treatment. Your health care provider may use electrocardiogram (ECG) results to describe these types of heart attacks.

An acute complete blockage of a medium or large heart artery usually means you've had an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
A partial blockage often means you've had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). However, some people with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) have a total blockage.
Not all heart attacks are caused by blocked arteries. Other causes include:

Coronary artery spasm. This is a severe squeezing of a blood vessel that's not blocked. The artery generally has cholesterol plaques or there is early hardening of the vessel due to smoking or other risk factors. Other names for coronary artery spasms are Prinzmetal's angina, vasospastic angina or variant angina.
Certain infections. COVID-19 and other viral infections may cause damage to the heart muscle.
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). This life-threatening condition is caused by a tear inside a heart artery."
heart attack,MedlinePlus,"A substance called plaque can build up in the walls of your coronary arteries. This plaque is made up of cholesterol and other cells.

A heart attack may occur when:

A disruption in the plaque occurs. This triggers blood platelets and other substances to form a blood clot at the site that blocks most or all of the oxygen-carrying blood from flowing to a part of the heart muscle. This is the most common cause of heart attack.
The cause of heart attack is not always known, but there are well known risk factors.

Heart attack may occur:

When you are resting or asleep
After a sudden increase in physical activity
When you are active outside in cold weather
After sudden, severe emotional or physical stress, including an illness"
heart attack,Healthline,"The leading cause of heart attacks is coronary heart disease. This is where plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. The general buildup of plaque in the arteries is also known as atherosclerosis.

There are two main types of heart attack.

Type I heart attacks are where plaque on the inner wall of the artery ruptures and releases cholesterol and other substances into the bloodstream. This can then form a blood clot and block the artery.

In type II heart attacks the heart does not receive as much oxygen-rich blood as it needs, but there is not a complete blockage of an artery.

Other causes of heart attacks include:

torn blood vessels
blood vessel spasms
drug misuse
hypoxia, lack of oxygen in the blood"
hemorrhoids,MayoClinic,"The veins around the anus tend to stretch under pressure and may bulge or swell. Hemorrhoids can develop from increased pressure in the lower rectum due to:

Straining during bowel movements.
Sitting for long periods of time, especially on the toilet.
Having chronic diarrhea or constipation.
Being obese.
Being pregnant.
Having anal intercourse.
Eating a low-fiber diet.
Regularly lifting heavy items."
hemorrhoids,MedlinePlus,"Hemorrhoids are very common. They result from increased pressure on the anus. This can occur during pregnancy or childbirth, and due to constipation. The pressure causes the normal anal veins and tissue to swell. This tissue can bleed, often during bowel movements.

Hemorrhoids may be caused by:

Straining during bowel movements
Constipation
Sitting for long periods of time, especially on the toilet
Certain diseases, such as cirrhosis"
hemorrhoids,Healthline,"Hemorrhoids occur when there’s too much pressure on the veins around your anus. Possible causes and risk factors include:

straining during a bowel movement
sitting for a long period of time, especially on the toilet
having chronic constipation or diarrhea
having a family history of hemorrhoids
engaging in consistent heavy lifting or other activities that strain your body
having obesity
having anal sexual intercourse, which can irritate hemorrhoids
being pregnant (an enlarged uterus presses on the vein in the colon, causing it to bulge)
being over the age of 50"
hepatitis A,MayoClinic,"Hepatitis A is caused by a virus that infects liver cells and causes inflammation. The inflammation can affect how your liver works and cause other symptoms of hepatitis A.

The virus spreads when infected stool, even just tiny amounts, enters the mouth of another person (fecal-oral transmission). You may get hepatitis A when you eat or drink something contaminated with infected stool. You may also get the infection through close contact with a person who has hepatitis A. The virus can live on surfaces for a few months. The virus does not spread through casual contact or by sneezing or coughing.

Here are some of the specific ways the hepatitis A virus can spread:

Eating food handled by someone with the virus who doesn't thoroughly wash hands after using the toilet
Drinking contaminated water
Eating food washed in contaminated water
Eating raw shellfish from water polluted with sewage
Being in close contact with a person who has the virus — even if that person has no symptoms
Having sexual contact with someone who has the virus"
hepatitis A,MedlinePlus,"Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus spreads through contact with an infected person's stool. This can happen if you:

Eat food made by someone who has the virus and did not properly wash their hands after using the bathroom
Drink contaminated water or eat foods that were rinsed with contaminated water
Have close personal contact with someone who has hepatitis A. This could be through certain types of sex (like oral-anal sex), taking care of someone who is ill, or using illegal drugs with others."
hepatitis A,Healthline,"People develop a hepatitis A infection after contracting HAV. This virus is typically transmitted by ingesting food or liquid contaminated with fecal matter that contains the virus. Once transmitted, the virus spreads through the bloodstream to the liver, where it causes inflammation and swelling.

In addition to transmission from eating food or drinking water containing HAV, the virus can also be spread by close personal contact with someone who already has it. HAV is contagious, and a person who has hepatitis A can easily pass the disease to others living in the same household.

You can contract hepatitis A by:

eating food prepared by someone with the hepatitis A virus
eating food handled by preparers who don’t follow strict hand-washing routines before touching food that you eat
eating sewage-contaminated raw shellfish
having sex with someone who has the hepatitis A virus
drinking polluted water
coming in contact with hepatitis A-infected fecal matter"
hepatitis B,MayoClinic,"Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The virus passes from person to person through blood, semen or other body fluids. It does not spread by sneezing or coughing.

Common ways that HBV can spread are:

Sexual contact. You may get hepatitis B if you have sex with someone who is infected and you don't use a condom. The virus can pass to you if the person's blood, saliva, semen or vaginal fluids enter your body.
Sharing of needles. HBV easily spreads through needles and syringes that are tainted with infected blood. Sharing equipment used to inject illicit drugs puts you at high risk of hepatitis B.
Accidental needlesticks. Hepatitis B is a concern for healthcare workers and anyone else who comes in contact with human blood.
Pregnant person to newborn. Pregnant people infected with HBV can pass the virus to their babies during childbirth. But the newborn can be vaccinated to prevent getting infected in almost all cases. Talk with your healthcare professional about being tested for hepatitis B if you are pregnant or want to become pregnant."
hepatitis B,MedlinePlus,"You can catch hepatitis B infection through contact with the blood or body fluids (semen, vaginal fluids, and saliva) of a person who has the virus.

Exposure may occur:

After a needlestick or sharps injury
If any blood or other body fluid touches your skin, eyes or mouth, or open sores or cuts
People who may be at risk for hepatitis B are those who:

Have unprotected sex with an infected partner
Receive blood transfusions (not common in the United States)
Have contact with blood at work (such as health care workers)
Have been on long-term kidney dialysis
Get a tattoo or acupuncture with unclean needles
Share needles or straws during drug use
Share personal items (such as toothbrush, razor, and nail clippers) with a person who has the virus
Were born to a hepatitis-B infected mother
All blood used for blood transfusions is screened, so the chance of getting the virus in this way is very small."
hepatitis B,Healthline,"Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. There are other forms of hepatitis, namely A, C, D, and E. Hepatitis B can cause an acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) infection.

The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through bodily fluids, especially blood. It can also be transmitted through semen and vaginal fluids. Although the virus can be detected in saliva, it’s not transmitted through saliva."
hepatitis C,MayoClinic,"Hepatitis C infection is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The infection spreads when blood that has the virus enters the bloodstream of a person who isn't affected.

Around the world, hepatitis C infection exists in several forms, called genotypes. There are seven genotypes and 67 subtypes. The most common hepatitis C genotype in the United States is type 1.

Chronic hepatitis C follows the same course no matter what the genotype of the infecting virus. But treatment can vary depending on viral genotype. However, newer antiviral drugs can treat many genotypes."
hepatitis C,MedlinePlus,"Hepatitis C infection is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV).

You can catch hepatitis C if the blood of someone who has HCV enters your body. Exposure may occur:

After a needle stick or sharps injury
If blood from someone who has HCV contacts a cut on your skin or contacts your eyes or mouth
While injecting street drugs
People at risk for HCV are those who:

Inject street drugs or share a needle with someone who has HCV
Have been on long-term kidney dialysis
Have regular contact with blood at work (such as a health care worker)
Have unprotected sexual contact with a person who has HCV
Were born to a mother who had HCV

HIV,MayoClinic,"HIV is caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact, shooting of illicit drugs or use of shared needles, and contact with infected blood. It also can spread from parent to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.

HIV destroys white blood cells called CD4 T cells. These cells play a large role in helping the body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes."
HIV,MedlinePlus,"HIV is spread through certain body fluids from a person who has HIV. This can happen:

By having unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a person who has HIV. ""Unprotected"" means not using condoms or medicine to treat or prevent HIV. This is the most common way that it spreads.
By sharing drug needles.

hives,MayoClinic,"When you experience an allergic reaction to a substance, your body releases histamine and other chemicals into the bloodstream, leading to symptoms such as itching, swelling, and other discomforts. Hives are a common result of such reactions, particularly among individuals with other allergies like hay fever.

Angioedema, which is swelling in deeper layers of tissue, can sometimes accompany hives. It can occur anywhere on the body but is especially concerning when it affects the mouth or throat, as it may cause severe symptoms like airway obstruction.

Various substances can trigger hives, including:

Animal dander (especially from cats)
Insect bites

hives,Healthline,"Hives are usually caused by an allergic reaction to something that you have encountered or swallowed. When you have an allergic reaction, your body begins to release histamines into your blood. Histamines are chemicals your body produces in an attempt to defend itself against infection and other outside intruders.

In some people, histamines can cause swelling, itching, and many of the symptoms that are experienced with hives. In terms of allergens, hives can be caused by factors such as pollen, medications, food, animal dander, and insect bites.

Hives might also be caused by circumstances besides allergies. It’s not uncommon for people to experience hives as the result of stress, tight clothes, exercise, illnesses, or infections.

It’s also possible to develop hives as the result of excessive exposure to hot or cold temperatures or from irritation due to excessive sweating. Because there are several potential triggers, many times the actual cause of hives can’t be determined."
kidney stones,MayoClinic,"Kidney stones often have no definite, single cause, although several factors may increase your risk.

Kidney stones form when your urine contains more crystal-forming substances — such as calcium, oxalate and uric acid — than the fluid in your urine can dilute. At the same time, your urine may lack substances that prevent crystals from sticking together, creating an ideal environment for kidney stones to form.

Types of kidney stones
Knowing the type of kidney stone you have helps determine its cause, and may give clues on how to reduce your risk of getting more kidney stones. If possible, try to save your kidney stone if you pass one so that you can bring it to your doctor for analysis.

Types of kidney stones include:

Calcium stones. Most kidney stones are calcium stones, usually in the form of calcium oxalate. Oxalate is a substance made daily by your liver or absorbed from your diet. Certain fruits and vegetables, as well as nuts and chocolate, have high oxalate content.

Dietary factors, high doses of vitamin D, intestinal bypass surgery and several metabolic disorders can increase the concentration of calcium or oxalate in urine.

Calcium stones may also occur in the form of calcium phosphate. This type of stone is more common in metabolic conditions, such as renal tubular acidosis. It may also be associated with certain medications used to treat migraines or seizures, such as topiramate (Topamax, Trokendi XR, Qudexy XR).

Struvite stones. Struvite stones form in response to a urinary tract infection. These stones can grow quickly and become quite large, sometimes with few symptoms or little warning.
Uric acid stones. Uric acid stones can form in people who lose too much fluid because of chronic diarrhea or malabsorption, those who eat a high-protein diet, and those with diabetes or metabolic syndrome. Certain genetic factors also may increase your risk of uric acid stones.
Cystine stones. These stones form in people with a hereditary disorder called cystinuria that causes the kidneys to excrete too much of a specific amino acid."
kidney stones,MedlinePlus,"Genetic changes can increase the risk of developing kidney stones, often acting in combination with a variety of environmental and lifestyle factors. Most genes involved in the condition are important for transmitting chemical signals from outside cells to inside cells or transporting materials in and out of cells. These processes help regulate the levels of various materials within cells, including the minerals and compounds that make up kidney stones. Changes in these genes can alter the levels of these materials in cells, leading to an imbalance of minerals and compounds in urine. As a result, the likelihood of stone formation increases.

A key factor that contributes to the development of kidney stones is too little water in the body (dehydration). When a person is dehydrated, they excrete less water in their urine, so the urine becomes concentrated with minerals and compounds that can cluster to form stones. Eating certain foods, such as animal proteins or foods high in sodium, can increase the likelihood of developing stones. A diet deficient in calcium can increase levels of other substances that cause stone development in individuals who have a history of kidney stones. Additionally, people who take certain medications, such as diuretics, which help remove water and salt from the body through urine, or calcium antacids, which treat indigestion by neutralizing stomach acids, are more likely to develop kidney stones.

In most cases, kidney stones occur without any other health issues. However, some people develop kidney stones as part of another condition. About half of people who develop calcium stones have high levels of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria). Hypercalciuria often runs in families. Some other health conditions that increase the risk of kidney stones include obesity, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (abnormal inflammation of the intestinal walls), gout (abnormal inflammation in the joints caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood), hyperparathyroidism (overactivity of the parathyroid glands), renal tubular acidosis (kidney dysfunction that leads to too much acid in the blood), and recurrent urinary tract infections."
kidney stones,Healthline,"Kidney stones are most likely to occur in people between the ages of 20 and 50.

Different factors can increase your risk of developing a stone. In the United States, white people are more likely to have kidney stones than Black people.

Sex also plays a role. More men than women develop kidney stones, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)Trusted Source.

A history of kidney stones can increase your risk. So does a family history of kidney stones.

Other risk factors include:

dehydration
obesity
a diet with high levels of protein, salt, or glucose
hyperparathyroid condition
gastric bypass surgery
inflammatory bowel diseases that increase calcium absorption
taking medications such as triamterene diuretics, antiseizure drugs, and calcium-based antacids"
obesity,MayoClinic,"Although there are genetic, behavioral, metabolic and hormonal influences on body weight, obesity occurs when you take in more calories than you burn through typical daily activities and exercise. Your body stores these excess calories as fat.

In the United States, most people's diets are too high in calories — often from fast food and high-calorie beverages. People with obesity might eat more calories before feeling full, feel hungry sooner, or eat more due to stress or anxiety.

Many people who live in Western countries now have jobs that are much less physically demanding, so they don't tend to burn as many calories at work. Even daily activities use fewer calories, courtesy of conveniences such as remote controls, escalators, online shopping, and drive-through restaurants and banks."
obesity,MedlinePlus,"Taking in more calories than your body uses can lead to obesity. This is because your body stores unused calories as fat. Obesity can be caused by:

Eating more food than your body can use
Drinking too much alcohol
Not getting enough exercise
Many people with obesity who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost.

Today, we know that biology is a big reason why some people cannot keep the weight off. Some people who live in the same place and eat the same foods develop obesity, while others do not. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system does not work as well as it should.

The way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults.

The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat.

We may feel that we are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active.

Many people feel they do not have time to plan and make healthy meals.
Many people do not have ready access to healthy foods making it difficult to plan and make healthy meals.
More people today work desk jobs compared to more active jobs in the past.
People with little free time may have less time to exercise.
The term eating disorder means a group of medical conditions that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. A person may have obesity, follow an unhealthy diet, and have an eating disorder all at the same time.

Sometimes, medical problems or treatments cause or contribute to weight gain, including:

Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)
Medicines such as birth control pills, antidepressants, and antipsychotics
Other things that can cause weight gain are:

Quitting smoking -- Many people who quit smoking gain 4 to 10 pounds (lb) or 2 to 5 kilograms (kg) in the first 6 months after quitting.
Stress, anxiety, feeling sad, depression, or not sleeping well.
Menopause -- Women may gain 12 to 15 lb (5.5 to 7 kg) during menopause.
Pregnancy -- Women may not lose the weight they gained during pregnancy."
obesity,Healthline,"Taking in more calories than you burn in daily activity and exercise — on a long-term basis — can lead to obesity. Over time, these extra calories add up and cause weight gain.

But it’s not always just about calories in and calories out or having a sedentary lifestyle. While those are indeed causes of obesity, some causes you can’t control.

Common specific causes of obesity include:

genetics, which can affect how your body processes food into energy and how fat is stored
growing older, which can lead to less muscle mass and a slower metabolic rate, making it easier to gain weight
not sleeping enough, which can lead to hormonal changes that make you feel hungrier and crave certain high calorie foods
high stress, which may trigger the production of hormones that cause you to eat more and store more fat
pregnancy, as weight gained during pregnancy may be difficult to lose and might eventually lead to obesity
Certain health conditions can also lead to weight gain, which may lead to obesity. These include:

metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors that include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high levels of triglycerides, low levels of HDL cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist that raise your chance of developing certain serious health conditions
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition that causes an imbalance of hormones called androgens
Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare condition present at birth that causes excessive hunger
Cushing syndrome, a condition caused by having high levels of cortisol (the stress hormone) in your system
hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough of certain important hormones
osteoarthritis (OA) and other conditions that cause pain that may lead to reduced activity"
osteoarthritis,MayoClinic,"Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage that cushions the ends of bones in your joints gradually deteriorates. Cartilage is a firm, slippery tissue that enables nearly frictionless joint motion.

Eventually, if the cartilage wears down completely, bone will rub on bone.

Osteoarthritis has often been referred to as a wear and tear disease. But besides the breakdown of cartilage, osteoarthritis affects the entire joint. It causes changes in the bone and deterioration of the connective tissues that hold the joint together and attach muscle to bone. It also causes inflammation of the joint lining."
osteoarthritis,MedlinePlus,"Common variations that affect many genes, some of which are unidentified, contribute to the risk of developing osteoarthritis. The condition was once believed to be caused primarily by ""wear and tear"" damage to the joints over time. However, it is now thought to be mainly the result of the body's failed attempts to repair this damage. In healthy cartilage, there is a balance between buildup and breakdown of the tissue. This balance is lost in osteoarthritis, leading to cartilage damage and, over time, complete breakdown. Without the protection of the cartilage, bone damage occurs at the joint. In response, the body builds new bone, which leads to overgrowth and reduced mobility of the joints. In addition, the cartilage damage triggers an immune response, causing inflammation of other joint tissues and leading to further joint damage.

The majority of variations associated with osteoarthritis risk are thought to act by subtly changing the amount, timing, and location of gene activity (expression). The genes whose expression influences osteoarthritis risk are typically involved in the formation and maintenance of bone and cartilage. For example, some of these genes are involved in the development of cartilage; if the genes are not expressed in the right location, at the right time, or in the right amount due to genetic variations, the function of this tissue may be impaired and the risk of developing osteoarthritis may be increased.

In most cases, multiple genetic changes, each with a small effect, combine to increase the risk of developing the disorder. The genetic changes can also interact with environmental and lifestyle factors that are associated with osteoarthritis risk, such as obesity and activity that places excessive stress on the joints."
osteoarthritis,Healthline,"Osteoarthritis is caused by gradual joint and cartilage damage.

Cartilage is a tough, rubbery substance that protects the ends of bones within a joint, allowing them to move easily against each other. With osteoarthritis, this cartilage breaks down over time, leading to bones rubbing against each other. This may cause intense pain and other osteoarthritis symptoms.

Researchers don’t yet know the underlying cause of this gradual joint degeneration, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.

However, several osteoarthritis risk factors have been identified, which may contribute to the development and progression of the condition. These may include:

genetics, such as having a family member with the condition
past injuries, such as torn cartilage, dislocated joints, or ligament injuries
being age 50 years and older
being assigned female at birth
having overweight or obesity
having gone through menopause
having an occupation that involves kneeling, climbing, heavy lifting, or similar actions
having another medical condition that affects your joint health, such as a different type of arthritis"
osteoporosis,MayoClinic,"Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease and significantly increases the risk of fractures. Approximately half of women over the age of 50 will experience a fracture of the hip, wrist, or spine during their lifetime, with spine fractures being the most prevalent.

Calcium and phosphate are vital minerals required for building and maintaining strong, healthy bones. Throughout life, your body continually breaks down old bone and forms new bone. When this process is balanced, bones remain strong. However, when the body reabsorbs more bone than it creates, bone loss occurs. In some cases, this happens without a known cause, while in others, it may run in families. Bone loss is most common in older white women.

Brittle and fragile bones can develop when the body reabsorbs too much bone or fails to produce enough new bone. Aging can lead to the reabsorption of calcium and phosphate from bones, weakening them.

A major risk factor is insufficient calcium intake, which prevents the creation of new bone tissue. Consuming calcium-rich foods and getting enough vitamin D are essential, as vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium. Bones may become brittle and prone to fractures if:

You do not consume enough calcium and vitamin D.
Your body fails to absorb enough calcium and vitamin D, such as after gastric bypass surgery or due to certain medical conditions.
Other factors contributing to bone loss include:

Reduced estrogen levels in women during menopause and decreased testosterone levels in aging men.
Prolonged bed rest due to illness, which primarily affects children.
Medical conditions causing increased inflammation, such as Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis.
Certain medications, including seizure medications, hormone therapies for prostate or breast cancer, and long-term steroid use (over three months)."
osteoporosis,MedlinePlus,"Osteoporosis is the most common type of bone disease.

Osteoporosis increases the risk for breaking a bone. About one half of all women over the age of 50 will have a fracture of the hip, wrist, or vertebra (bones of the spine) during their lifetime. Spine fractures are the most common.

Your body needs the minerals calcium and phosphate to make and keep healthy bones.

During your life, your body continues to both reabsorb old bone and create new bone.
As long as your body has a good balance of new and old bone, your bones stay healthy and strong.
Bone loss occurs when more old bone is reabsorbed than new bone is created.
Sometimes, bone loss occurs without any known cause. Other times, bone loss and thin bones run in families. In general, white, older women are the most likely to have bone loss.

Brittle, fragile bones can be caused by anything that makes your body reabsorb too much bone, or keeps your body from making enough new bone. As you age, your body may reabsorb calcium and phosphate from your bones instead of keeping these minerals in your bones. This makes your bones weaker.

A major risk is not consuming enough calcium to build new bone tissue. It is important to eat/drink enough high-calcium foods. You also need vitamin D, because it helps your body absorb calcium. Your bones may become brittle and more likely to fracture if:

If you do not eat enough food with calcium and vitamin D
Your body does not absorb enough calcium and vitamin D from your food, such as after gastric bypass surgery or due to other medical conditions
Other causes of bone loss include:

A decrease in estrogen in women at the time of menopause and a decrease in testosterone in men as they age
Being confined to a bed due to a prolonged illness (mostly affects bones in children)
Having certain medical conditions that cause increased inflammation in the body such as Crohn disease or rheumatoid arthritis
Taking certain medicines, such as certain seizure medicines, hormone treatments for prostate or breast cancer, and steroid medicines taken for more than 3 months"
osteoporosis,Healthline,"Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease, significantly increasing the likelihood of fractures. Around half of women over 50 will suffer a fracture in the hip, wrist, or spine during their lifetime, with spine fractures being the most frequent.

To build and maintain strong bones, the body relies on calcium and phosphate. Throughout life, bones undergo a continuous process of breakdown and renewal. As long as this process remains balanced, bones stay strong. However, bone loss occurs when the body reabsorbs more bone than it produces. In some cases, this happens without an identifiable cause, while in others, it may run in families. Older white women are particularly at risk for bone loss.

Weak, brittle bones result from the body absorbing too much bone or failing to produce sufficient new bone. Aging can also lead to the loss of calcium and phosphate from bones, further weakening them.

A major factor in preventing bone loss is consuming enough calcium to support bone formation. It’s crucial to eat calcium-rich foods and get sufficient vitamin D, which aids in calcium absorption. Bones can become fragile and more prone to fractures if:

You don’t consume enough calcium and vitamin D.
Your body cannot effectively absorb calcium and vitamin D, which can occur after gastric bypass surgery or due to specific medical conditions.

Other causes of bone loss include:

Decreased estrogen in women after menopause and reduced testosterone in aging men.
Prolonged bed rest due to illness, particularly affecting children’s bones.
Chronic inflammatory conditions like Crohn’s disease or rheumatoid arthritis.
Certain medications, including seizure drugs, hormone therapies for prostate or breast cancer, and long-term use of steroids (over three months)."
Parkinson's disease,MayoClinic,"In Parkinson's disease, nerve cells in the brain called neurons slowly break down or die. Many Parkinson's disease symptoms are caused by a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in the brain. This messenger is called dopamine.

Decreased dopamine leads to irregular brain activity. This causes movement problems and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease. People with Parkinson's disease also lose a chemical messenger called norepinephrine that controls many body functions, such as blood pressure.

The cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but several factors seem to play a role, including:

Genes. Specific genetic changes are linked to Parkinson's disease. But these are rare unless many family members have had Parkinson's disease.
Environmental factors. Exposure to certain toxins or other environmental factors may increase the risk of later Parkinson's disease. One example is MPTP, a substance that can be found in illegal drugs and is sometimes sold illegally as ""synthetic heroin."" Other examples include pesticides and well water used for drinking. But no environmental factor has proved to be a cause.
Many changes happen in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease. Researchers are studying why the changes happen and the roles they play. These changes include:

The presence of Lewy bodies. Clumps of proteins in the brain are associated with Parkinson's disease. These are called Lewy bodies, and researchers believe these proteins hold an important clue to the cause of Parkinson's disease.
Alpha-synuclein found within Lewy bodies. Alpha-synuclein is a protein found in all Lewy bodies. It occurs in a clumped form that cells can't break down. This is currently an important focus among Parkinson's disease researchers. Alpha-synuclein has been found in the spinal fluid of people who later have Parkinson's disease.
Altered mitochondria. Mitochondria are powerhouse compartments inside cells that create most of the body's energy. Changes to mitochondria can cause cell damage. These changes have been found in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease."
Parkinson's disease,MedlinePlus,"Nerve cells use a brain chemical called dopamine to help control muscle movement. With Parkinson disease, the brain cells that make dopamine slowly die. Without enough dopamine, the cells that control movement can't send proper messages to the muscles. This makes it hard to control the muscles. Slowly, over time, this damage gets worse. No one knows exactly why these brain cells waste away.

Parkinson disease most often develops after age 60. It is one of the most common nervous system problems in older adults.

The disease affects men more often than women, although women also develop the disease. Parkinson disease sometimes runs in families.
The disease can occur in younger adults. In such cases, it is often due to the person's genes.
Parkinson disease is rare in children."
Parkinson's disease,Healthline,"The exact cause of Parkinson’s is unknown. It may have both genetic and environmental components. Some scientists believe that viruses can trigger Parkinson’s as well.

Low levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, a substance that regulates dopamine, have been linked with Parkinson’s.

Abnormal proteins called Lewy bodies have also been found in the brains of people with Parkinson’s. Scientists do not know what role, if any, Lewy bodies play in the development of Parkinson’s.

While there’s no known cause, research has identified groups of people who are more likely to develop the condition, which include:

Sex. Men are one and a half times more likely to develop Parkinson’s than women.
Race. According to research, there’s a higher prevalence of Parkinson’s in white people compared with Black or Asian people. Geographic location may be one reason for a higher risk.
Age. Parkinson’s usually appears between ages 50 and 60 years. It only occurs before 40 years old in about four percent of cases.
Family history. People who have close family members with Parkinson’s disease are more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease.
Toxins. Exposure to certain toxins may increase the risk of Parkinson’s disease.
Head injury. People who experience head injuries may be more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease."
psoriatic arthritis,MayoClinic,"Psoriatic arthritis occurs when your body's immune system attacks healthy cells and tissue. The immune response causes inflammation in your joints as well as overproduction of skin cells.

It seems likely that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in this immune system response. Many people with psoriatic arthritis have a family history of either psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. Researchers have discovered certain genetic markers that appear to be associated with psoriatic arthritis.

Physical trauma or something in the environment — such as a viral or bacterial infection — might trigger psoriatic arthritis in people with an inherited tendency."
psoriatic arthritis,MedlinePlus,"The specific cause of psoriatic arthritis is unknown. Its signs and symptoms result from excessive inflammation in and around the joints. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. When this has been accomplished, the body ordinarily stops the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues. Mechanical stress on the joints, such as occurs in movement, may result in an excessive inflammatory response in people with psoriatic arthritis. The reasons for this excessive inflammatory response are unclear.

Researchers have identified changes in several genes that may influence the risk of developing psoriatic arthritis. The most well-studied of these genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. Variations of several HLA genes seem to affect the risk of developing psoriatic arthritis, as well as the type, severity, and progression of the condition.

Variations in several other genes have also been associated with psoriatic arthritis. Many of these genes are thought to play roles in immune system function. However, variations in these genes probably make only a small contribution to the overall risk of developing psoriatic arthritis. Other genetic and environmental factors are also likely to influence a person's chances of developing this disorder."
psoriatic arthritis,Healthline,"In PsA, your immune system attacks your joints and skin. Doctors don’t know for sure what causes these attacks. They think it stems from a combination of genes and environmental factors.

PsA runs in families. About 40% of people with the condition have one or more relatives with PsA. Something in the environment usually triggers the disease for those with a tendency to develop PsA. That could be a virus, extreme stress, or an injury."
cirrhosis,MayoClinic,"A wide range of diseases and conditions can damage the liver and lead to cirrhosis.

Some of the causes include:

Long-term alcohol abuse.
Ongoing viral hepatitis (hepatitis B, C and D).
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a condition in which fat accumulates in the liver.
Hemochromatosis, a condition that causes iron buildup in the body.
Autoimmune hepatitis, which is a liver disease caused by the body's immune system.

delirium,MayoClinic,"Delirium occurs when signals in the brain aren't sent and received properly.

The disorder may have a single cause or more than one cause. For example, a medical condition combined with the side effects of a medicine could cause delirium. Sometimes no cause can be found. Possible causes include:

Certain medicines or medicine side effects
Alcohol or drug use or withdrawal
A medical condition such as a stroke, heart attack, worsening lung or liver disease, or an injury from a fall
An imbalance in the body, such as low sodium or low calcium
Severe, long-lasting illness or an illness that will lead to death
Fever and a new infection, particularly in children
Urinary tract infection, pneumonia, the flu or COVID-19, especially in older adults
Exposure to a toxin, such as carbon monoxide, cyanide or other poisons
Poor nutrition or a loss of too much body fluid
Lack of sleep or severe emotional distress

Pain
Sleep problems
Mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression
Allergies
Asthma
Swelling
Parkinson's disease
Spasms or convulsions"
delirium,MedlinePlus,"Delirium is most often caused by physical or mental illness and is usually temporary and reversible. Many disorders may cause delirium. Often, these disorders do not allow the brain to get oxygen or other substances. They may also cause dangerous chemicals (toxins) to build up in the brain. Delirium is common in the intensive care unit (ICU), especially in older adults.

Causes include:

Alcohol or medicine overdose or withdrawal
Drug use or overdose, including being sedated in the ICU
Electrolyte or other body chemical disturbances
Infections such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia, or meningitis
Severe lack of sleep
Poisons
General anesthesia and surgery
Autoimmune disease"
delirium,Healthline,"Delirium happens when stressors like inflammation or infection interfere with your brain function. There are many possible causes.

Medication side effects are a major cause of delirium. Up to 39% of the time, delirium is caused by medications."
epilepsy,MayoClinic,"Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including:

Genetic influence. Some types of epilepsy run in families. In these instances, it's likely that there's a genetic influence. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes. But some people have genetic epilepsy that isn't hereditary. Genetic changes can occur in a child without being passed down from a parent.

For most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures.

Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy.
Factors in the brain. Brain tumors can cause epilepsy. Epilepsy also may be caused by the way blood vessels form in the brain. People with blood vessel conditions such as arteriovenous malformations and cavernous malformations can have seizures. And in adults older than age 35, stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy.
Infections. Meningitis, HIV, viral encephalitis and some parasitic infections can cause epilepsy.
Injury before birth. Before they're born, babies are sensitive to brain damage that could be caused by several factors. They might include an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or not enough oxygen. This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy.
Developmental conditions. Epilepsy can sometimes occur with developmental conditions. People with autism are more likely to have epilepsy than are people without autism. Research also has found that people with epilepsy are more likely to have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other developmental conditions. Having both conditions may be related to genes.
Seizure triggers
Seizures can be triggered by things in the environment. Seizure triggers don't cause epilepsy, but they may trigger seizures in people who have epilepsy. Most people with epilepsy don't have reliable triggers that always cause a seizure. However, they often can identify factors that make it easier to have a seizure. Possible seizure triggers include:

Alcohol.
Flashing lights.
Illicit drug use.
Skipping doses of antiseizure medicines or taking more than prescribed.
Lack of sleep.
Hormone changes during the menstrual cycle.
Stress.
Dehydration.
Skipped meals.
Illness."
epilepsy,MedlinePlus,"In about half of all cases, the cause of epilepsy is unknown. For the other half, the condition may be linked to various factors, including:

Genetic factors: Some forms of epilepsy are hereditary, suggesting a genetic component. Researchers have identified specific genes associated with certain types of epilepsy. However, some individuals may have genetic epilepsy that is not inherited, as genetic mutations can occur spontaneously. Typically, genes are only part of the equation, with environmental factors potentially triggering seizures in genetically predisposed individuals.

Head trauma: Severe head injuries, such as those sustained in car accidents or other traumatic events, can lead to epilepsy.

Brain-related factors: Brain tumors and abnormalities in blood vessel formation, such as arteriovenous or cavernous malformations, can cause epilepsy. In adults over 35, strokes are a leading cause.

Infections: Conditions such as meningitis, HIV, viral encephalitis, and certain parasitic infections can result in epilepsy.

Prenatal injury: The developing brain of a fetus is particularly vulnerable to damage from maternal infections, poor nutrition, or oxygen deprivation, potentially leading to epilepsy or cerebral palsy.

Developmental conditions: Epilepsy often occurs alongside developmental disorders. For example, individuals with autism are at a higher risk of epilepsy. Similarly, epilepsy is more common in those with ADHD or other developmental conditions, likely due to shared genetic factors.

Seizure Triggers
While triggers do not cause epilepsy, they can provoke seizures in those with the condition. Not everyone with epilepsy has consistent triggers, but many can identify factors that increase their likelihood of experiencing a seizure. Common triggers include:

Alcohol consumption.
Flashing lights.
Use of illicit drugs.
Missing doses or taking incorrect doses of antiseizure medication.
Sleep deprivation.
Hormonal changes, such as during the menstrual cycle.
Stress.
Dehydration.
Skipped meals.
Illness.
Understanding these factors can help manage and reduce the risk of seizures."
epilepsy,Healthline,"In about half of people with epilepsy, the cause cannot be determined, per the WHO. A variety of factors can contribute to the development of seizures, such as:

traumatic brain injury or other head trauma
brain scarring after a brain injury (post-traumatic epilepsy)
serious illness or very high fever
stroke, which causes about half of epilepsy cases in older adults when there’s no identifiable cause, according to the CDC
lack of oxygen to the brain
brain tumor or cyst
dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease
maternal use of some drugs, prenatal injury, brain malformation, or lack of oxygen at birth
infectious conditions like HIV and AIDS and meningitis
genetic or developmental disorders or neurological diseases
Epilepsy can develop at any age, but diagnosis usually occurs in early childhood or after 60 years old."
heart failure,MayoClinic,"Heart failure can be caused by a weakened, damaged or stiff heart.

If the heart is damaged or weakened, the heart chambers may stretch and get bigger. The heart can't pump out the needed amount of blood.
If the main pumping chambers of the heart, called the ventricles, are stiff, they can't fill with enough blood between beats.
The heart muscle can be damaged by certain infections, heavy alcohol use, illegal drug use and some chemotherapy medicines. Your genes also can play a role.

Any of the following conditions also can damage or weaken the heart and cause heart failure.

Coronary artery disease and heart attack. Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure. The disease results from the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries. The deposits narrow the arteries. This reduces blood flow and can lead to heart attack.

A heart attack occurs suddenly when an artery feeding the heart becomes completely blocked. Damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack may mean that the heart can no longer pump as well as it should.

High blood pressure. Also called hypertension, this condition forces the heart to work harder than it should to pump blood through the body. Over time, the extra work can make the heart muscle too stiff or too weak to properly pump blood.
Heart valve disease. The valves of the heart keep blood flowing the right way. If a valve isn't working properly, the heart must work harder to pump blood. This can weaken the heart over time. Treating some types of heart valve problems may reverse heart failure.
Inflammation of the heart muscle, also called myocarditis. Myocarditis is most commonly caused by a virus, including the COVID-19 virus, and can lead to left-sided heart failure.
A heart problem that you're born with, also called a congenital heart defect. If the heart and its chambers or valves haven't formed correctly, the other parts of the heart have to work harder to pump blood. This may lead to heart failure.
Irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias. Irregular heart rhythms may cause the heart to beat too fast, creating extra work for the heart. A slow heartbeat also may lead to heart failure. Treating an irregular heart rhythm may reverse heart failure in some people.
Other diseases. Some long-term diseases may contribute to chronic heart failure. Examples are diabetes, HIV infection, an overactive or underactive thyroid, or a buildup of iron or protein.
Causes of sudden heart failure also include:

Allergic reactions.
Any illness that affects the whole body.
Blood clots in the lungs.
Severe infections.
Use of certain medicines.
Viruses that attack the heart muscle.
Heart failure usually begins with the lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle. This is the heart's main pumping chamber. But heart failure also can affect the right side. The lower right heart chamber is called the right ventricle. Sometimes heart failure affects both sides of the heart."
heart failure,MedlinePlus,"Heart failure is most often a long-term (chronic) condition, but it may come on suddenly. It can be caused by many different heart problems.

The condition may affect only the right side or only the left side of the heart. Both sides of the heart also can be involved.

Heart failure is present when:

Your heart muscle cannot contract very well. This is called systolic heart failure, or heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
Your heart muscle is stiff and does not fill up with blood easily even though pumping power is normal. This is called diastolic heart failure, or heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
As the heart's pumping becomes less effective, blood may back up in other areas of the body. Fluid may build up in the lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and the arms and legs. This is called congestive heart failure or, more simply, just heart failure.

Other diseases that can cause or contribute to heart failure:

Amyloidosis
Emphysema
Overactive thyroid
Sarcoidosis
Severe anemia
Too much iron in the body (usually due to hereditary hemochromatosis)
Underactive thyroid

The most common causes of heart failure are:

Coronary artery disease (CAD), a narrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. This can weaken the heart muscle over time or suddenly.
High blood pressure that is not well controlled, leading to problems with stiffness, or eventually leading to muscle weakening.

Other heart problems that may cause heart failure are:

Congenital heart disease
Heart attack (when coronary artery disease results in a sudden blockage of a heart artery)
Heart valves that are leaky or narrowed
Infection that weakens the heart muscle
Some types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)"
heart failure,Healthline,"Heart failure happens when your heart muscle gets weak or stiff. This may then block or reduce blood flow to the heart.

The most common cause of heart failure is coronary artery disease (CAD). It happens when fatty deposits build up in your arteries, reducing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

Other conditions that may increase your risk of developing heart failure include:

heart attack
inherited heart disease
a condition that weakens the heart muscle, like cardiomyopathy
heart inflammation, like myocarditis
high blood pressure, also called hypertension
arrhythmia, which is an irregular heart rhythm
viral infection
congenital heart disease

obesity
pressure in your lungs, called pulmonary hypertension
overactive thyroid, also known as hyperthyroidism
Certain behaviors may also increase your risk of developing heart failure, including:

smoking
drinking alcohol
eating foods high in fat or cholesterol
not getting enough physical activity"
peptic ulcer,MayoClinic,"Peptic ulcers happen when acid in the organs that food travels through, called the digestive tract, eats away at the inner surface of the stomach or small intestine. The acid can create a painful open sore that may bleed.

Your digestive tract is coated with a mucous layer that most often protects against acid. But if the amount of acid increases or the amount of mucus decreases, you could develop an ulcer.

Common causes include:

Helicobacter pylori. This germ lives in the mucous layer that covers and protects tissues that line the stomach and small intestine. The H. pylori germ often causes no problems. But it can cause swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the stomach's inner layer. When this happens, it can cause an ulcer.

It's not clear how H. pylori infection spreads. It may go from person to person by close contact, such as kissing. People also can contract H. pylori through food and water.

Regular use of certain pain relievers. Taking aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) over time can irritate or inflame the lining of the stomach and small intestine. These medicines include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox DS, others), ketoprofen and others. They do not include acetaminophen (Tylenol, others)."
peptic ulcer,MedlinePlus,"Normally, the lining of the stomach and small intestines can protect itself against strong stomach acids. But if the lining breaks down, the result may be:

Swollen and inflamed tissue (gastritis)
An ulcer

Most ulcers occur in the first, inner surface, layer of the inner lining. A hole in the stomach or duodenum is called a perforation. This is a medical emergency.

The most common cause of ulcers is infection of the stomach by bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H pylori). Most people with peptic ulcers have these bacteria living in their digestive tract. Yet, many people who have these bacteria in their stomach do not develop an ulcer.

The following factors raise your risk for peptic ulcers:

Drinking too much alcohol
Regular use of aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco
Being very ill, such as being on a breathing machine
Radiation treatments
Stress
A rare condition, called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, causes the stomach to produce too much acid, leading to stomach and duodenal ulcers."
peptic ulcer,Healthline,"Different factors can cause the lining of the stomach, the esophagus, and the small intestine to break down. These include:

H. pylori, a type of bacteria that can cause a stomach infection and inflammation
frequent use of aspirin (Bayer), ibuprofen (Advil), and other anti-inflammatory drugs (risk associated with this behavior increases in women and people over the age of 60)
smoking
drinking too much alcohol
radiation therapy
stomach cancer"
urinary tract infection (UTI),MayoClinic,"UTIs typically occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and begin to spread in the bladder. The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.

The most common UTIs occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.

Infection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.

Having sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.

Infection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina."
urinary tract infection (UTI),MedlinePlus,"Anything that impairs bladder emptying or irritates the urinary tract can contribute to the development of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Several factors can increase the risk of experiencing a UTI, including:

Age: Older adults are more prone to UTIs.
Reduced mobility: Prolonged bed rest or recovery after surgery can increase the risk.
Kidney stones: These can obstruct urine flow, promoting bacterial growth.
History of UTIs: A previous UTI can raise the likelihood of recurrence.
Urinary tract obstructions or blockages, such as:
Enlarged prostate.
Kidney stones.
Certain types of cancer.
Prolonged use of urinary catheters: This can facilitate the entry of bacteria into the bladder.
Diabetes: High blood sugar levels can promote bacterial growth.
Pregnancy: Hormonal and physical changes during pregnancy can increase susceptibility.
Congenital abnormalities: Structural abnormalities of the urinary tract present from birth can impair urine flow.
Weakened immune system: Conditions that compromise the immune system make it harder to fight infections.
Recognizing these risk factors can help in prevention and management of UTIs."
urinary tract infection (UTI),Healthline,"Anything that reduces your bladder emptying or irritates the urinary tract can lead to a UTI. There are also many factors that can put you at an increased risk of getting a UTI.

age (older adults are more likely to get UTIs)
reduced mobility after surgery or prolonged bed rest
kidney stones
a previous UTI
urinary tract obstructions or blockages, like:
enlarged prostate
kidney stones
certain forms of cancer
prolonged use of urinary catheters, which may make it easier for bacteria to get into your bladder
diabetes
pregnancy
abnormally developed urinary structures from birth
weakened immune system"
melanoma,MayoClinic,"Melanoma happens when something changes healthy melanocytes into cancer cells. Melanocytes are skin cells that make pigment that gives skin its color. The pigment is called melanin.

Melanoma starts when melanocytes develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. In healthy cells, DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.

The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer.

It isn't clear what changes the DNA in skin cells and how it leads to melanoma. It's likely a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors. Still, healthcare professionals believe exposure to ultraviolet light is the leading cause of melanoma. Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, comes from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds.

UV light doesn't cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don't receive exposure to sunlight. This means that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma."
melanoma,MedlinePlus,"Melanoma is caused by changes (mutations) in skin cells called melanocytes. These cells make a skin color pigment called melanin. Melanin is responsible for skin and hair color.

Melanoma can appear on normal skin. Sometimes it can develop from moles. Moles that are present at birth may develop into melanomas. Larger moles that are present at birth may be at higher risk for developing melanoma.

There are four major types of melanoma:

Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common type. It is usually flat and irregular in shape and color, with different shades of black and brown. It is most common in fair skin people.
Nodular melanoma usually starts as a raised area that is dark blackish-blue or bluish-red. Some do not have any color (amelanotic melanoma).
Lentigo maligna melanoma usually occurs in older people. It is most common in sun-damaged skin on the face, neck, and arms. The abnormal skin areas are usually large, flat, and tan with areas of brown.
Acral lentiginous melanoma is the least common form. It usually occurs on the palms, soles, or under the nails.

The risk for developing melanoma increases with age. However, more and more young people are developing it.

You are more likely to develop melanoma if you:

Have fair skin, blue or green eyes, or red or blond hair
Live in sunny climates or at high altitudes
Spent a lot of time in high levels of strong sunlight because of a job or other activities
Have had one or more blistering sunburns during childhood
Use tanning devices, such as tanning beds
Other risk factors include:

Having close relatives with melanoma
Certain types of moles (atypical or dysplastic) or many birthmarks
Weakened immune system due to disease or medicines"
melanoma,Healthline,"Melanoma develops when healthy melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells that give skin its color, transform into cancer cells. This pigment is called melanin.

Melanoma begins when the DNA of melanocytes undergoes changes. DNA contains the instructions that guide a cell's behavior. In healthy cells, DNA directs growth and division at a controlled pace and signals when cells should die. In cancer cells, changes in the DNA provide abnormal instructions, causing cells to multiply rapidly and avoid normal cell death. This leads to an accumulation of abnormal cells.

These cancerous cells may form a mass known as a tumor, which can grow and damage healthy tissues. Over time, the cancer cells may detach and spread to other parts of the body, a process called metastasis.

The exact cause of DNA changes in melanocytes that lead to melanoma is unclear. It is likely influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. However, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, from the sun or artificial sources like tanning beds, is considered the primary cause of melanoma.

Not all melanomas are caused by UV light, especially those occurring in areas of the body not exposed to sunlight. This suggests that additional factors may also play a role in increasing the risk of melanoma."
gastritis,MayoClinic,"Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining. The stomach lining is a mucus-lined barrier that protects the stomach wall. Weaknesses or injury to the barrier allows digestive juices to damage and inflame the stomach lining. Several diseases and conditions can increase the risk of gastritis. These include inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn's disease."
gastritis,MedlinePlus,"The most common causes of gastritis are:

Certain medicines, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen and other similar drugs
Heavy alcohol drinking
Infection of the stomach with a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori
Less common causes are:

Autoimmune disorders (such as pernicious anemia)
Backflow of bile into the stomach (bile reflux)
Cocaine use
Eating or drinking caustic or corrosive substances (such as poisons)
Extreme stress
Viral infection, such as cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus (more often occurs in people with a weak immune system)
Trauma or a severe, sudden illness such as major surgery, kidney failure, or being placed on a breathing machine may cause gastritis."
gastritis,Healthline,"Weakness in your stomach lining allows digestive juices to damage and inflame it, causing gastritis. Having a thin or damaged stomach lining raises your risk for gastritis.

A gastrointestinal bacterial infection can also cause gastritis. The most common bacterial infection that causes it is H. pylori, a bacterium that infects the lining of the stomach. The infection is usually passed from person to person, but it can also be transmitted through contaminated food or water.

Certain conditions and activities may increase your risk for developing gastritis. Other risk factors include:

extreme alcohol consumption
routine use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen and aspirin
cocaine use
age, because the stomach lining thins naturally with age
tobacco use
Other less common risk factors include:

stress
autoimmune disorders
digestive disorders like Crohn’s disease
viral infections"
glaucoma,MayoClinic,"Glaucoma develops when the optic nerve becomes damaged. As this nerve gradually gets worse, blind spots develop in your vision. For reasons that eye doctors don't fully understand, this nerve damage is usually related to increased pressure in the eye.

Raised eye pressure happens as the result of a buildup of fluid that flows throughout the inside of the eye. This fluid, called the aqueous humor, usually drains through a tissue located at the angle where the iris and cornea meet. This tissue is called the trabecular meshwork. The cornea is important to vision because it lets light into the eye. When the eye makes too much fluid or the drainage system doesn't work properly, eye pressure may increase.

Open-angle glaucoma
This is the most common form of glaucoma. The drainage angle formed by the iris and cornea remains open. But other parts of the drainage system don't drain properly. This may lead to a slow, gradual increase in eye pressure.

Acute angle-closure glaucoma
This form of glaucoma happens when the iris bulges. The bulging iris partially or completely blocks the drainage angle. As a result, fluid can't circulate through the eye and pressure increases. Angle-closure glaucoma may happen suddenly or gradually.

Normal-tension glaucoma
No one knows the exact reason why the optic nerve becomes damaged when eye pressure is healthy. The optic nerve may be sensitive or experience less blood flow. This limited blood flow may be caused by the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries or other conditions that damage circulation. The buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries also is known as atherosclerosis.

Glaucoma in children
A child may be born with glaucoma or develop it in the first few years of life. Blocked drainage, injury or an underlying medical condition may cause optic nerve damage.

Pigmentary glaucoma
In pigmentary glaucoma, small pigment granules flake off from the iris and block or slow fluid drainage from the eye. Activities such as jogging sometimes stir up the pigment granules. That leads to a deposit of pigment granules on tissue located at the angle where the iris and cornea meet. The granule deposits cause an increase in pressure.

Glaucoma tends to run in families. In some people, scientists have identified genes related to high eye pressure and optic nerve damage."
glaucoma,MedlinePlus,"Glaucoma occurs when the optic nerve becomes damaged, leading to the development of blind spots in vision. This nerve damage is often associated with increased pressure in the eye, though the exact reasons for the damage are not fully understood by eye specialists.

Increased eye pressure results from the buildup of fluid, known as aqueous humor, inside the eye. This fluid typically drains through a tissue called the trabecular meshwork, located at the angle where the iris and cornea meet. The cornea plays a crucial role in vision by allowing light to enter the eye. If the eye produces too much fluid or if the drainage system is impaired, eye pressure can rise.

Types of Glaucoma
Open-Angle Glaucoma
The most common form, this occurs when the drainage angle between the iris and cornea remains open, but other parts of the drainage system do not function properly. This leads to a gradual increase in eye pressure over time.

Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma
This form arises when the iris bulges, blocking the drainage angle either partially or completely. Fluid becomes trapped, causing a rapid or gradual rise in eye pressure.

Normal-Tension Glaucoma
In this type, the optic nerve becomes damaged despite normal eye pressure. The cause is unclear but may involve increased sensitivity of the optic nerve or reduced blood flow, possibly due to atherosclerosis (buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries) or other circulation-related conditions.

Glaucoma in Children
Glaucoma can affect children from birth or during their early years. Causes may include blocked drainage, injury, or underlying medical conditions leading to optic nerve damage.

Pigmentary Glaucoma
In this form, pigment granules from the iris flake off and obstruct or slow the drainage of fluid. Physical activities like jogging may dislodge these granules, causing them to accumulate at the drainage angle and increase eye pressure.

Genetic Factors
Glaucoma often runs in families. Scientists have identified certain genes associated with high eye pressure and optic nerve damage, suggesting a hereditary component to the condition."
glaucoma,Healthline,"The back of your eye continuously makes a clear fluid called aqueous humor. As this fluid is made, it fills the front part of your eye. Then, it leaves your eye through channels in your cornea and iris. If these channels are blocked or partially obstructed, the natural pressure in your eye, which is called the intraocular pressure (IOP), may increase. As your IOP increases, your optic nerve may become damaged. As damage to your nerve progresses, you may begin losing sight in your eye.

What causes the pressure in your eye to increase isn’t always known. However, doctors believe one or more of these factors may play a role:

dilating eye drops
blocked or restricted drainage in your eye
medications, such as corticosteroids
poor or reduced blood flow to your optic nerve
high or elevated blood pressure"
tachycardia,MayoClinic,"Tachycardia is an increased heart rate for any reason. If a fast heart rate is caused by exercise or stress, it's called sinus tachycardia. Sinus tachycardia is a symptom, not a condition.

Most heart conditions can lead to different forms of tachycardia. Irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias, are one cause. An example of an irregular heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AFib).

Other things that may lead to tachycardia include:

Fever.
Excessive alcohol use, which is defined as 14 or more drinks a week for a man or seven or more drinks a week for a woman.
Alcohol withdrawal.
Too much caffeine.
High or low blood pressure.
Changes in the level of minerals in the body, called electrolytes. Examples include potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium.
Certain medicines.
Overactive thyroid, called hyperthyroidism.

anemia,MayoClinic,"Anemia occurs when the blood doesn't have enough hemoglobin or red blood cells.

This can happen if:

The body doesn't make enough hemoglobin or red blood cells.
Bleeding causes loss of red blood cells and hemoglobin faster than they can be replaced.
The body destroys red blood cells and the hemoglobin that's in them.
What red blood cells do
The body makes three types of blood cells. White blood cells fight infection, platelets help blood clot and red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body.

Red blood cells have an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color, called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin lets red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. And it lets red blood cells carry carbon dioxide from other parts of the body to the lungs to be breathed out.

Spongy matter inside many of the large bones, called bone marrow, makes red blood cells and hemoglobin. To make them, the body needs iron, vitamin B-12, folate and other nutrients from foods.

Causes of anemia
Different types of anemia have different causes. They include:

Iron deficiency anemia. Too little iron in the body causes this most common type of anemia. Bone marrow needs iron to make hemoglobin. Without enough iron, the body can't make enough hemoglobin for red blood cells.

Pregnant people can get this type of anemia if they don't take iron supplements. Blood loss also can cause it. Blood loss might be from heavy menstrual bleeding, an ulcer, cancer or regular use of some pain relievers, especially aspirin.

Vitamin deficiency anemia. Besides iron, the body needs folate and vitamin B-12 to make enough healthy red blood cells. A diet that doesn't have enough of these and other key nutrients can result in the body not making enough red blood cells.

Also, some people can't absorb vitamin B-12. This can lead to vitamin deficiency anemia, also called pernicious anemia.

Anemia of inflammation. Diseases that cause ongoing inflammation can keep the body from making enough red blood cells. Examples are cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease and Crohn's disease.
Aplastic anemia. This rare, life-threatening anemia occurs when the body doesn't make enough new blood cells. Causes of aplastic anemia include infections, certain medicines, autoimmune diseases and being in contact with toxic chemicals.
Anemias linked to bone marrow disease. Diseases such as leukemia and myelofibrosis can affect how the bone marrow makes blood. The effects of these types of diseases range from mild to life-threatening.
Hemolytic anemias. This group of anemias is from red blood cells being destroyed faster than bone marrow can replace them. Certain blood diseases increase how fast red blood cells are destroyed. Some types of hemolytic anemia can be passed through families, which is called inherited.
Sickle cell anemia. This inherited and sometimes serious condition is a type of hemolytic anemia. An unusual hemoglobin forces red blood cells into an unusual crescent shape, called a sickle. These irregular blood cells die too soon. That causes an ongoing shortage of red blood cells."
anemia,MedlinePlus,"Anemia occurs when the blood has insufficient levels of hemoglobin or red blood cells. This can happen due to:

The body not producing enough hemoglobin or red blood cells.
Loss of red blood cells and hemoglobin due to bleeding faster than they can be replenished.
The body destroying red blood cells and their hemoglobin.
Role of Red Blood Cells
Blood contains three types of cells:

White blood cells: Fight infection.
Platelets: Help with blood clotting.
Red blood cells: Carry oxygen to the body and remove carbon dioxide.
Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. Hemoglobin allows red blood cells to transport oxygen from the lungs to tissues and carbon dioxide from tissues back to the lungs for exhalation.

Red blood cells and hemoglobin are produced in the bone marrow, the spongy tissue within large bones. The production process requires nutrients like iron, vitamin B-12, folate, and other dietary components.

Causes of Anemia
Different types of anemia have various causes, including:

Iron-deficiency anemia: The most common type, caused by insufficient iron. Iron is necessary for the bone marrow to produce hemoglobin. It can result from inadequate dietary iron, blood loss (e.g., heavy menstrual periods, ulcers, cancer), or lack of iron supplementation during pregnancy.

Vitamin deficiency anemia: Inadequate folate or vitamin B-12 in the diet can hinder red blood cell production. Some people cannot absorb vitamin B-12 properly, leading to pernicious anemia.

Anemia of inflammation: Chronic diseases like cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, or Crohn's disease can interfere with red blood cell production.

Aplastic anemia: A rare but life-threatening condition where the body stops making enough new blood cells. Causes include infections, certain medications, autoimmune diseases, and exposure to toxic chemicals.

Anemias related to bone marrow diseases: Disorders like leukemia or myelofibrosis can disrupt red blood cell production in the bone marrow. Severity can range from mild to life-threatening.

Hemolytic anemias: This group of anemias occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the bone marrow can replace them. Some forms are inherited, while others result from blood disorders.

Sickle cell anemia: An inherited type of hemolytic anemia where abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to form a crescent (sickle) shape. These cells break down prematurely, leading to a persistent shortage of red blood cells."
anemia,Healthline,"Red blood cells are produced in your bone marrow and have an average lifespan of 100 to 120 days. On average, your bone marrow produces 2 million red blood cells each second while approximately the same number are removed from circulation.

About 1 percent of your red blood cells are removed from circulation and replaced each day.

Any process that has a negative effect on this balance between red blood cell production and destruction can cause anemia.

Causes of anemia are generally divided into those that decrease red blood cell production and those that increase red blood cell destruction or loss.

Factors that decrease red blood cell production
When red blood cell production is lower than normal, more red blood cells are leaving your body than entering circulation. This can potentially lead to anemia.

Factors that decrease red blood cells production can be divided into two categories – acquired and inherited.

Acquired factors that can decrease RBC production include:

inadequate dietary intake of nutrients important for red blood cells production, such as iron, vitamin B12, or folate
kidney disease
some types of cancer, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma
autoimmune diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis
certain kinds of infections, such as HIV and tuberculosis
hypothyroidism
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) like ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease
aplastic anemia
certain types of medications or treatments, particularly chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer
exposure to toxins, such as lead
Some types of genetic (inherited) conditions are also associated with a decrease in production of healthy red blood cells. These include:

Fanconi anemia
Schwachman-Diamond syndrome
Diamond-Blackfan anemia
dyskeratosis congenita
amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia
Factors that increase red blood cell destruction or loss
On the other hand, anything that causes destruction or loss of red blood cells at a rate faster than they’re made can also cause anemia.

Factors that increase the destruction of red blood cells can also be either acquired or inherited.

Some acquired factors that may lead to increased red blood cell destruction or loss are:

blood loss, which can happen due to:
accidents or injuries
surgery
heavy menstrual bleeding
childbirth
endometriosis
gastrointestinal lesions, such as ulcers or those due to IBD or cancer
heavy nosebleeds
frequent blood donation
hemolysis, which is when red blood cells break down too soon due to things like:
autoimmune activity
certain infections
medication side effects
exposure to toxins
enlarged spleen
liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis
infections like malaria
Some inherited causes of increased red blood cell destruction can include:

sickle cell disease
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency
thalassemia
pyruvate kinase deficiency
hereditary spherocytosis
hereditary elliptocytosis"
pancreatitis,MayoClinic,"The pancreas has two major roles. It produces insulin, which helps the body manage and use sugars.

The pancreas also produces dietary juices, called enzymes, that help with digestion. The pancreas makes and stores ""turned off"" versions of the enzymes. After the pancreas sends the enzymes into the small intestine, they are ""turned on"" and break down proteins in the small intestine.

If the enzymes are turned on too soon, they can start acting like digestive juices inside the pancreas. The action can irritate, damage or destroy cells. This problem, in turn, leads to immune system responses that cause swelling and other events that affect how the pancreas works.

Several conditions can lead to acute pancreatitis, including:

Blockage in the bile duct caused by gallstones.
Heavy alcohol use.
Certain medicines.
High triglyceride levels in the blood.
High calcium levels in the blood.
Pancreas cancer.
Injuries from trauma or surgery.
Conditions that can lead to chronic pancreatitis include:

Damage from repeated acute pancreatitis.
Heavy alcohol use.
Inherited genes linked to pancreatitis.
High triglyceride levels in the blood.
High calcium levels in the blood.
Sometimes, a cause for pancreatitis is never found. This is known as idiopathic pancreatitis."
pancreatitis,MedlinePlus,"There are a number of factors that can cause pancreatitis. The most common causes are:

Gallstones (digestive fluids that become solid and form stones in the gallbladder)
Heavy alcohol use
Genetic disorders of the pancreas
Certain medicines

Other causes include:

Smoking
High levels of triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood)
High levels of parathyroid hormone in the blood (called hyperparathyroidism)
High levels of calcium in the blood (called hypercalcemia)
Cancer of the pancreas
Cystic fibrosis
A family history of pancreatitis
Abdominal surgery
Injury to the abdomen"
pancreatitis,Healthline,"Acute and chronic pancreatitis share many of the same causes. These include:

gallstones
drinking a lot of alcohol
some medications
pancreatic cancer
abdominal surgery
infections
cystic fibrosis
injury to your belly
High levels of calcium or triglycerides (a type of fat) in the blood can also lead to chronic pancreatitis.

Gallstones are the most common cause of acute pancreatitis. Gallstones are small, solid masses that form from bile, a fluid that helps with digestion.

A large enough gallstone can get stuck at the junction where the main pancreatic duct and the common bile duct come together. These ducts empty into the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine.

The pancreatic duct carries digestive enzymes from the pancreas. The common bile duct carries bile or other substances from the liver and the gallbladder.

A stuck gallstone can cause a backup of these substances, leading to inflammation in both the common bile duct and the pancreas."
tuberculosis,MayoClinic,"Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

People with active TB disease in the lungs or voice box can spread the disease. They release tiny droplets that carry the bacteria through the air. This can happen when they're speaking, singing, laughing, coughing or sneezing. A person can get an infection after inhaling the droplets.

The disease is more likely to spread when people spend a lot of time together in an indoor space. So the disease spreads easily in places where people live or work together for long periods. Also, the disease spreads more easily in crowded gatherings.

A person with a latent TB infection cannot pass the disease to other people. A person taking drugs to treat active TB disease usually can't pass the disease after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment.

Drug-resistant TB
Some forms of the TB bacteria have become drug resistant. This means that drugs that once cured the disease no longer work.

This happens, in part, because of naturally occurring genetic changes in bacteria. A random genetic change in a bacterium might give it some quality that makes it more likely to survive the attack of an antibiotic. If it does survive, then it can multiply.

When antibiotic drugs aren't used correctly — or drugs fail to kill all the bacteria for another reason — the conditions are ideal for more-resistant versions of the bacteria to get established and multiply. If these bacteria are passed on to other people, a new drug-resistant strain can grow over time.

Problems that can lead to such drug-resistant strains of bacteria include the following:

People didn't follow directions for taking the drugs or stopped taking the drugs.
They weren't prescribed the right treatment plan.
Drugs were not available.
The drugs were of poor quality.
The body didn't absorb the drugs as expected."
tuberculosis,MedlinePlus,"TB is caused by bacteria (germs) called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The germs spread from person to person through the air. People who have TB disease in their throat or lungs spread the germs in the air when they cough, sneeze, talk, or sing. If you breathe in the air that has the germs, you can get TB.

TB is not spread by touching, kissing, or sharing food or dishes.

You're more likely to catch TB from people you live or work with than from people you see for shorter amounts of time.

Who is more likely to get infected with tuberculosis (TB) germs?
Anyone who is near a person with TB disease can get infected with the germs. You are more likely to be near someone with TB disease if you:

Were born in or often travel to countries where TB disease is common
Are a health care worker
Work or live in a place where TB is more common, such as shelters for people without homes, jails, and nursing homes
Who is more likely to develop TB disease?
Certain people are more likely to get sick with TB disease after they get infected. They include people who:

Have HIV
Became infected with TB in the last 2 years
Have other diseases, such as diabetes, that make it hard for your body to fight TB germs
Have alcohol use disorder (AUD) or inject illegal drugs
Were not treated correctly for TB in the past
Are under age 5
Are an older adult
Take medicines that weaken the immune system, such as medicines taken after an organ transplant, steroids, and specialized treatments for certain autoimmune diseases"
tuberculosis,Healthline,"A bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes TB. A variety of TB strains exist, and some of these have become resistant to medication.

TB bacteria are transmitted through infected droplets in the air. Once these droplets enter the air, anyone nearby can inhale them. Someone with TB can transmit bacteria by:

sneezing
coughing
speaking
singing
People with well-functioning immune systems may not experience TB symptoms, even if they’ve contracted the bacteria. This is known as latent or inactive TB infection. About a quarter of the world’s population has latent TB.

Latent TB is not contagious, but it can become active disease over time. Active TB disease can make you sick, and you can also spread it to others."
chickenpox,MayoClinic,"Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, a member of the herpesvirus family. This same virus can later cause shingles in adults.

Chickenpox is highly contagious and can spread from 1 to 2 days before the blisters appear until all the blisters have crusted over. You can catch chickenpox through:

Direct contact with the fluid from a chickenpox blister.
Breathing in droplets when someone with the disease coughs or sneezes nearby.
Most cases occur in children under the age of 10 and are usually mild. However, adults and older children often experience more severe symptoms.

Infants whose mothers have had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine are less likely to contract the disease before their first birthday. If they do, they usually experience mild symptoms, as maternal antibodies passed through the bloodstream offer some protection. Conversely, infants under 1 year old whose mothers have not had chickenpox or the vaccine are at higher risk of severe illness.

Severe cases of chickenpox are more common in children with weakened immune systems."
chickenpox,MedlinePlus,"Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is a member of the herpesvirus family. The same virus also causes shingles in adults.

Chickenpox can be spread very easily to others from 1 to 2 days before blisters appear until all the blisters have crusted over. You may get chickenpox:

From touching the fluids from a chickenpox blister
If someone with the disease coughs or sneezes near you
Most cases of chickenpox occur in children younger than age 10. The disease is most often mild, although serious complications may occur. Adults and older children get sicker than younger children in most cases.

Children whose mothers have had chickenpox or have received the chickenpox vaccine are not very likely to catch it before they are 1 year old. If they do catch chickenpox, they often have mild cases. This is because antibodies from their mothers' blood help protect them. Children under 1 year old whose mothers have not had chickenpox or the vaccine can get severe chickenpox.

Severe chickenpox symptoms are more common in children whose immune system does not work well."
chickenpox,Healthline,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes the chickenpox infection. Most cases occur through contact with an infected person. The virus is contagious to those around you for one to two days before your blisters appear. VZV remains contagious until all blisters have crusted over. The virus can spread through:

saliva
coughing
sneezing
contact with fluid from the blisters"
mumps,MayoClinic,"Mumps is caused by a type of germ called a virus. When someone has mumps, the virus is in saliva. Coughing or sneezing can release tiny droplets with the virus into the air.

You can get the virus by breathing in tiny droplets. Or you can get the virus by touching a surface where droplets have landed and then touching your face. You also can pick up the virus from direct contact, such as kissing or sharing a water bottle.

Outbreaks in the United States most often happen where people live or work in close contact. These may include college campuses, summer camps and schools."
mumps,MedlinePlus,"Mumps is caused by a virus. The virus spreads from person to person by drops of moisture from the nose and mouth, such as through sneezing. It is also spread through direct contact with items that have infected saliva on them.

Mumps most often occurs in children ages 2 through 12 who have not been vaccinated against the disease. However, the infection can occur at any age and may also be seen in college age students.

The time between being exposed to the virus and getting sick (incubation period) is about 12 to 25 days."
mumps,Healthline,"Mumps is a viral infection that spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets, such as those released when sneezing. It can also be transmitted through direct contact with objects contaminated with infected saliva.

Mumps most commonly affects children aged 2 to 12 who have not been vaccinated, but it can occur at any age, including in college-aged individuals.

The incubation period, or the time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms, typically ranges from 12 to 25 days."
tetanus,MayoClinic,"The bacterium that causes tetanus is called Clostridium tetani. The bacterium can survive in a dormant state in soil and animal feces. It's essentially shut down until it discovers a place to thrive.

When the dormant bacteria enter a wound — a condition good for growth — the cells are ""awakened."" As they are growing and dividing, they release a toxin called tetanospasmin. The toxin impairs the nerves in the body that control muscles."
tetanus,MedlinePlus,"Spores of the bacterium C tetani are found in the soil, and in animal feces and mouth (gastrointestinal tract). In the spore form, C tetani can remain inactive in the soil. But it can remain infectious for more than 40 years.

You can get tetanus infection when the spores enter your body through an injury or wound. The spores become active bacteria that spread in the body and make a poison called tetanus toxin (also known as tetanospasmin). This poison blocks nerve signals from your spinal cord to your muscles, causing severe muscle spasms. The spasms can be so powerful that they tear the muscles or cause fractures of the spine.

The time between infection and the first sign of symptoms is about 7 to 21 days. Nearly all cases of tetanus in the United States occur in those who have not been vaccinated against the disease."
tetanus,Healthline,"Bacteria called Clostridium tetani cause tetanus. Spores of the bacteria can be found in dust, dirt, and animal droppings. Spores are small reproductive bodies produced by certain organisms. They’re often resistant to harsh environmental conditions, such as high heat.

A person can become infected when these spores enter the bloodstream through a cut or deep wound. The bacteria spores then spread to the central nervous system and produce a toxin called tetanospasmin. This toxin is a poison that blocks the nerve signals from your spinal cord to your muscles. This can lead to severe muscle spasms.

Tetanus infection has been associated with:

crush injuries
injuries with dead tissue
burns
puncture wounds from piercings, tattoos, injection drug use, or injury (such as stepping on a nail)
wounds contaminated with dirt, feces, or saliva"
polio,MayoClinic,"Polio is caused by the poliovirus. It mainly targets nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain stem that control muscle movement. Nerve cells controlling sensation are generally not affected.

The naturally-occurring poliovirus, called the wild-type poliovirus, has been eliminated in most countries and causes few cases of polio. Another version of the virus, called the vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), is more widespread and now causes most infections worldwide. VDPV exists mainly in a few countries that use an oral vaccine with a weakened poliovirus.

The weakened virus in the oral vaccine doesn't itself cause polio, and vaccinated people rarely contract VDPV. Instead, VDPV is a new version of the virus that develops within a community or region where not enough people are vaccinated.

Even though the weakened virus in the oral vaccine doesn't cause illness, it can spread. If most people in a community are vaccinated, the spread of the weakened virus is controlled. If many people aren't vaccinated, the weakened virus can move through a community for a long time. This gives the virus the chance to change, or mutate, and behave like the wild-type virus that causes illness.

Infections from VDPV have been reported in the United States. In each case, the person was either not vaccinated or had a significantly weakened immune system. One case in New York in 2022 was in a county with a lower-than-average polio vaccination rate. Samples from wastewater showed that VDPV was spreading in some communities.

Since 2000, polio vaccination in the United States has used an injected vaccine with an inactivated poliovirus that doesn't create the risk for VDPV."
polio,MedlinePlus,"Polio is a disease caused by infection with the poliovirus. The virus spreads by:

Direct person-to-person contact
Contact with infected mucus or phlegm from the nose or mouth
Contact with infected feces
The virus enters through the mouth and nose, multiplies in the throat and intestinal tract, and then is absorbed and spread through the blood and lymph system. The time from being infected with the virus to developing symptoms of disease (incubation) ranges from 5 to 35 days (average 7 to 14 days). Most people do not develop symptoms.

Risks factors include:

Lack of immunization against polio
Travel to an area that has had a polio outbreak
As a result of a global vaccination campaign over the past 25 years, polio has largely been eliminated. The disease still exists in some countries (such as Pakistan and Afghanistan), with outbreaks occurring in groups of people who have not been vaccinated."
polio,Healthline,"Polio is caused by the poliovirus, which primarily targets nerve cells in the spinal cord and brainstem responsible for muscle movement. Nerve cells involved in sensation are generally unaffected.

The wild-type poliovirus, the naturally occurring strain, has been eliminated in most countries and now accounts for only a few cases of polio. However, the majority of infections worldwide are caused by the vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), a variant of the virus more prevalent in regions using an oral vaccine containing a weakened form of the poliovirus.

The weakened virus in the oral vaccine does not directly cause polio, and individuals vaccinated with it rarely contract VDPV. Instead, VDPV emerges in areas where vaccination rates are low, allowing the virus to circulate and evolve within the community.

While the weakened virus from the oral vaccine does not cause illness itself, it can spread within a population. In communities with high vaccination coverage, the spread is controlled. However, in areas with low vaccination rates, the virus can circulate for extended periods, increasing the likelihood of mutations that cause it to behave like the wild-type virus.

Cases of VDPV have been reported in the United States, primarily in individuals who were unvaccinated or had compromised immune systems. One notable case in New York in 2022 occurred in a county with below-average vaccination rates, and wastewater analysis confirmed the presence of VDPV in some communities."
lupus,MayoClinic,"As an autoimmune disease, lupus occurs when your immune system attacks healthy tissue in your body. It's likely that lupus results from a combination of your genetics and your environment.

It appears that people with an inherited predisposition for lupus may develop the disease when they come into contact with something in the environment that can trigger lupus. The cause of lupus in most cases, however, is unknown. Some potential triggers include:

Sunlight. Exposure to the sun may bring on lupus skin lesions or trigger an internal response in susceptible people.
Infections. Having an infection can initiate lupus or cause a relapse in some people.
Medications. Lupus can be triggered by certain types of blood pressure medications, anti-seizure medications and antibiotics. People who have drug-induced lupus usually get better when they stop taking the medication. Rarely, symptoms may persist even after the drug is stopped."
lupus,MedlinePlus,"The cause of lupus is unknown. Researchers are studying what might cause or trigger the disease, such as:

Genetics
Environmental factors, such as viral infections, sunlight, certain medicines, and smoking
Problems with the immune system"
lupus,Healthline,"While experts don’t know exactly what causes lupus, they think it may be a combination of many underlying factors. These may include:

Environment: A 2019 review identified potential triggers like smoking, stress, and exposure to toxins like silica dust as potential lupus causes.
Genetics: According to the Lupus Foundation of America, more than 50 genes associated with lupus have been identified. Additionally, having a family history of lupus may put a person at slightly higher risk for experiencing the condition.
Hormones: A 2019 review suggests that atypical hormone levels, such as increased estrogen levels, could contribute to lupus.
Infections: According to a 2021 review, experts are still studying the link between lupus and infections like cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr.
Medications: Long-term use of certain medications, such as hydralazine (Apresoline), procainamide (Procanbid), and quinidine, has been linked with DIL. Also, people taking TNF blocker medications for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease, and ankylosing spondylitis can develop DIL. Though rare, tetracyclines, like minocycline, which can be used to treat acne and rosacea, can cause DIL as well.
It’s also possible to have experienced none of the known potential causes of lupus listed here and still have the autoimmune disease."
hemophilia,MayoClinic,"When a person bleeds, the body typically pools blood cells together to form a clot to stop the bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins in the blood that work with cells known as platelets to form clots. Hemophilia occurs when a clotting factor is missing or levels of the clotting factor are low.

Congenital hemophilia
Hemophilia is usually inherited, meaning a person is born with the disorder (congenital). Congenital hemophilia is classified by the type of clotting factor that's low.

The most common type is hemophilia A, associated with a low level of factor 8 The next most common type is hemophilia B, associated with a low level of factor 9.

Acquired hemophilia
Some people develop hemophilia with no family history of the disorder. This is called acquired hemophilia.

Acquired hemophilia is a variety of the condition that occurs when a person's immune system attacks clotting factor 8 or 9 in the blood. It can be associated with:

Pregnancy
Autoimmune conditions
Cancer
Multiple sclerosis
Drug reactions
Hemophilia inheritance
In the most common types of hemophilia, the faulty gene is located on the X chromosome. Everyone has two sex chromosomes, one from each parent. Females inherit an X chromosome from the mother and an X chromosome from the father. Males inherit an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father.

This means that hemophilia almost always occurs in boys and is passed from mother to son through one of the mother's genes. Most women with the defective gene are carriers who have no signs or symptoms of hemophilia. But some carriers can have bleeding symptoms if their clotting factors are moderately decreased."
hemophilia,MedlinePlus,"Variants in the F8 gene cause hemophilia A, while variants in the F9 gene cause hemophilia B. The F8 gene provides instructions for making a protein called coagulation factor VIII. A related protein, coagulation factor IX, is produced from the F9 gene. Coagulation factors are proteins that work together in the blood clotting process. After an injury, blood clots protect the body by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing excessive blood loss.

Variants in the F8 or F9 gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII or coagulation factor IX, or reduce the amount of one of these proteins. The altered or missing protein cannot participate effectively in the blood clotting process. As a result, blood clots cannot form properly in response to injury. These problems with blood clotting lead to continuous bleeding that can be difficult to control. The variants that cause severe hemophilia almost completely eliminate the activity of coagulation factor VIII or coagulation factor IX. The variants involved in mild and moderate hemophilia reduce but do not eliminate the activity of one of these proteins.

Another form of the disorder, known as acquired hemophilia, is not caused by inherited gene variants. This rare condition is characterized by abnormal bleeding into the skin, muscles, or other soft tissues, usually beginning in adulthood. Acquired hemophilia results when the body makes specialized proteins called autoantibodies that attack and disable coagulation factor VIII. The production of autoantibodies is sometimes associated with pregnancy, immune system disorders, cancer, or allergic reactions to certain drugs. In about half of cases, the cause of acquired hemophilia is unknown."
hemophilia,Healthline,"When a person bleeds, the body typically stops the bleeding by forming a clot. This process involves clotting factors, which are proteins in the blood, working together with platelets (specialized blood cells) to create the clot. Hemophilia occurs when a clotting factor is either missing or present at low levels.

Congenital Hemophilia
Hemophilia is most commonly inherited, meaning it is present from birth (congenital). Congenital hemophilia is categorized based on which clotting factor is deficient:

Hemophilia A: The most common type, caused by a deficiency of clotting factor 8.
Hemophilia B: The second most common type, caused by a deficiency of clotting factor 9.
Acquired Hemophilia
Some individuals develop hemophilia later in life, even without a family history of the disorder. This is known as acquired hemophilia.

Acquired hemophilia occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks clotting factor 8 or 9 in the blood. It is associated with conditions such as:

Pregnancy
Autoimmune diseases
Cancer
Multiple sclerosis
Drug reactions
Hemophilia Inheritance
In the most common forms of hemophilia, the faulty gene is located on the X chromosome. Every individual inherits two sex chromosomes, one from each parent. Females inherit one X chromosome from their mother and one X chromosome from their father, while males inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father.

Because the faulty gene is on the X chromosome, hemophilia primarily affects males and is typically passed from mother to son. Most women who carry the defective gene are asymptomatic carriers, although some may experience mild bleeding symptoms if their clotting factor levels are moderately reduced."
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS),MayoClinic,"The cause of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is still unknown. A combination of factors may be involved, including:

Genetics. ME/CFS appears to run in some families, so some people may be born with a higher likelihood of developing the disorder.
Infections. Some people develop ME/CFS symptoms after getting better from a viral or bacterial infection.
Physical or emotional trauma. Some people report that they experienced an injury, surgery or significant emotional stress shortly before their symptoms began.
Problems with energy usage. Some people with ME/CFS have problems converting the body's fuel, primarily fats and sugars, into energy."
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS),MedlinePlus,"Scientists have been researching chronic fatigue syndrome for many years, but they still don't know for sure what causes it.

Many doctors believe that the way some conditions interact within the body and mind might leave some people at risk for CFS. For example, if someone has a virus and is under a lot of stress, the combination of these two things might make them more likely to develop CFS.

These things are believed to interact with each other in this way, putting some people at risk for CFS:

infections. Experts have wondered if infections like measles or Epstein-Barr virus (the virus that causes mono) might increase the risk for CFS. The role Epstein-Barr plays in CFS is not clear because studies have not confirmed it as a cause.
problems with the immune system or the nervous system
hormone imbalances
emotional stress
low blood pressure
Chronic fatigue syndrome can affect people of all ethnicities and ages, but it's most common in people in their forties or fifties. It's very rare in kids. A few teens do get CFS, and it affects more girls than guys.

Sometimes different people in the same family get CFS. This might be because the tendency to develop CFS is genetic, but more research is needed to see if this is true."
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS),Healthline,"The cause of CFS is unknown. Researchers speculate that contributing factors may include:

viruses
a weakened immune system
stress
hormonal imbalances
It’s also possible that some people are genetically predisposed to develop CFS.

Though CFS can sometimes develop after a viral infection, no single type of infection has been found to cause CFS. Some viral infections that have been studied in relation to CFS include those caused by:

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
human herpesvirus 6
Ross River virus (RRV)
rubella virus
Infections caused by bacteria, including Coxiella burnetii and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, have also been studied in relation to CFS.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has suggested that CFS may be the end stage of multiple different conditions, rather than one specific condition.

In fact, about 1 in 10 people with EBV, Ross River virus, or Coxiella burnetii infection will develop a condition that meets the criteria for a CFS diagnosis.

Additionally, researchers say that those who’ve had severe symptoms with any of these three infections are at a higher risk for later developing CFS.

People with CFS sometimes have weakened immune systems, but doctors don’t know whether this is enough to cause the disorder.

People with CFS can also sometimes have abnormal hormone levels. Doctors haven’t yet concluded whether this is significant, either.

Some people with CFS may concomitantly have some deficiencies in vitamins including B2 (riboflavin) or B12, but it is unclear if they improve with vitamin supplementation."
