diabetes,"To understand diabetes, it's important to understand how the body normally uses glucose.

How insulin works:
Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland behind and below the stomach (pancreas).

The pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream.
The insulin circulates, letting sugar enter the cells.
Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream.
As the blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from the pancreas.

The role of glucose:
Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.

Glucose comes from two major sources: food and the liver.
Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.
The liver stores and makes glucose.
When glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose. This keeps your glucose level within a typical range.

The exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown. In all cases, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. This is because the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of genetic or environmental factors. It is unclear what those factors may be."
pneumonia,"Many germs can cause pneumonia. The most common are bacteria and viruses in the air we breathe. Your body usually prevents these germs from infecting your lungs. But sometimes these germs can overpower your immune system, even if your health is generally good.

Pneumonia is classified according to the types of germs that cause it and where you got the infection.

Community-acquired pneumonia:
Community-acquired pneumonia is the most common type of pneumonia. It occurs outside of hospitals or other health care facilities. It may be caused by:

- Bacteria. The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the U.S. is Streptococcus pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur on its own or after you've had a cold or the flu. It may affect one part (lobe) of the lung, a condition called lobar pneumonia.
- Bacteria-like organisms. Mycoplasma pneumoniae also can cause pneumonia. It typically produces milder symptoms than do other types of pneumonia. Walking pneumonia is an informal name given to this type of pneumonia, which typically isn't severe enough to require bed rest.
- Fungi. This type of pneumonia is most common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems, and in people who have inhaled large doses of the organisms. The fungi that cause it can be found in soil or bird droppings and vary depending upon geographic location.
- Viruses, including COVID-19. Some of the viruses that cause colds and the flu can cause pneumonia. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years. Viral pneumonia is usually mild. But in some cases it can become very serious. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may cause pneumonia, which can become severe.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia
Some people catch pneumonia during a hospital stay for another illness. Hospital-acquired pneumonia can be serious because the bacteria causing it may be more resistant to antibiotics and because the people who get it are already sick. People who are on breathing machines (ventilators), often used in intensive care units, are at higher risk of this type of pneumonia.

Health care-acquired pneumonia
Health care-acquired pneumonia is a bacterial infection that occurs in people who live in long-term care facilities or who receive care in outpatient clinics, including kidney dialysis centers. Like hospital-acquired pneumonia, health care-acquired pneumonia can be caused by bacteria that are more resistant to antibiotics.

Aspiration pneumonia
Aspiration pneumonia occurs when you inhale food, drink, vomit or saliva into your lungs. Aspiration is more likely if something disturbs your normal gag reflex, such as a brain injury or swallowing problem, or excessive use of alcohol or drugs."
asthma,"It isn't clear why some people get asthma and others don't, but it's probably due to a combination of environmental and inherited (genetic) factors.

Asthma triggers
Exposure to various irritants and substances that trigger allergies (allergens) can trigger signs and symptoms of asthma. Asthma triggers are different from person to person and can include:

Airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander or particles of cockroach waste
Respiratory infections, such as the common cold
Physical activity
Cold air
Air pollutants and irritants, such as smoke
Certain medications, including beta blockers, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve)
Strong emotions and stress
Sulfites and preservatives added to some types of foods and beverages, including shrimp, dried fruit, processed potatoes, beer and wine
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat"
gout,"Gout occurs when urate crystals accumulate in your joint, causing the inflammation and intense pain of a gout attack. Urate crystals can form when you have high levels of uric acid in your blood. Your body produces uric acid when it breaks down purines — substances that are found naturally in your body.

Purines are also found in certain foods, including red meat and organ meats, such as liver. Purine-rich seafood includes anchovies, sardines, mussels, scallops, trout and tuna. Alcoholic beverages, especially beer, and drinks sweetened with fruit sugar (fructose) promote higher levels of uric acid.

Normally, uric acid dissolves in your blood and passes through your kidneys into your urine. But sometimes either your body produces too much uric acid or your kidneys excrete too little uric acid. When this happens, uric acid can build up, forming sharp, needlelike urate crystals in a joint or surrounding tissue that cause pain, inflammation and swelling."
malaria,"Malaria is caused by a single-celled parasite of the genus plasmodium. The parasite is transmitted to humans most commonly through mosquito bites.

Mosquito transmission cycle:
Malaria spreads when a mosquito becomes infected with the disease after biting an infected person, and the infected mosquito then bites a noninfected person. The malaria parasites enter that person's bloodstream and travel to the liver. When the parasites mature, they leave the liver and infect red blood cells.

-Uninfected mosquito. A mosquito becomes infected by feeding on a person who has malaria.
-Transmission of parasite. If this mosquito bites you in the future, it can transmit malaria parasites to you.
-In the liver. Once the parasites enter your body, they travel to your liver — where some types can lie dormant for as long as a year.
-Into the bloodstream. When the parasites mature, they leave the liver and infect your red blood cells. This is when people typically develop malaria symptoms.
-On to the next person. If an uninfected mosquito bites you at this point in the cycle, it will become infected with your malaria parasites and can spread them to the other people it bites.

Other modes of transmission
Because the parasites that cause malaria affect red blood cells, people can also catch malaria from exposure to infected blood, including:

From mother to unborn child
Through blood transfusions
By sharing needles used to inject drugs"
migraine,"Though migraine causes aren't fully understood, genetics and environmental factors appear to play a role.

Changes in the brainstem and its interactions with the trigeminal nerve, a major pain pathway, might be involved. So might imbalances in brain chemicals — including serotonin, which helps regulate pain in your nervous system.

Researchers are studying the role of serotonin in migraines. Other neurotransmitters play a role in the pain of migraine, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).

Migraine triggers
There are a number of migraine triggers, including:

Hormonal changes in women. Fluctuations in estrogen, such as before or during menstrual periods, pregnancy and menopause, seem to trigger headaches in many women.

Hormonal medications, such as oral contraceptives, also can worsen migraines. Some women, however, find that their migraines occur less often when taking these medications.

Drinks. These include alcohol, especially wine, and too much caffeine, such as coffee.
Stress. Stress at work or home can cause migraines.
Sensory stimuli. Bright or flashing lights can induce migraines, as can loud sounds. Strong smells — such as perfume, paint thinner, secondhand smoke and others — trigger migraines in some people.
Sleep changes. Missing sleep or getting too much sleep can trigger migraines in some people.
Physical strain. Intense physical exertion, including sexual activity, might provoke migraines.
Weather changes. A change of weather or barometric pressure can prompt a migraine.
Medications. Oral contraceptives and vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin, can aggravate migraines.
Foods. Aged cheeses and salty and processed foods might trigger migraines. So might skipping meals.
Food additives. These include the sweetener aspartame and the preservative monosodium glutamate (MSG), found in many foods."
appendicitis,"A blockage in the lining of the appendix, called the lumen, is the likely cause of appendicitis. This blockage can cause an infection. The bacteria then multiply quickly, causing the appendix to become inflamed, swollen and filled with pus. If not treated right away, the appendix may burst or break open."
diarrhea,"A number of diseases and conditions can cause diarrhea, including:

Viruses. Viruses that can cause diarrhea include Norwalk virus, also known as norovirus, enteric adenoviruses, astrovirus, cytomegalovirus and viruses that cause hepatitis. Rotavirus is a common cause of sudden childhood diarrhea. The virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also has been linked to gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
Bacteria and parasites. Exposure to certain bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, or parasites through contaminated food or water can lead to diarrhea. When traveling in developing countries, diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites is often called traveler's diarrhea. Clostridioides difficile, also known as C. diff, is another bacterium that causes diarrhea, and it can occur after a course of antibiotics or during a hospital stay.
Medicines. Many medicines, such as antibiotics, can cause diarrhea. Antibiotics get rid of infections by killing bacteria that cause illness, but they also kill good bacteria that are helpful in the body. This disturbs the natural balance of bacteria in the intestines, leading to diarrhea or an infection such as C. diff. Other medicines that cause diarrhea are anticancer drugs and antacids with magnesium.
Lactose intolerance. Lactose is a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. People who have trouble digesting lactose often have diarrhea after eating dairy products. Lactose intolerance can increase with age because levels of the enzyme that helps digest lactose become lower as people get older.
Fructose. Fructose is a sugar found naturally in fruits and honey. It's sometimes added as a sweetener to certain beverages. Fructose can lead to diarrhea in people who have trouble digesting it.
Artificial sweeteners. Sorbitol, erythritol and mannitol — nonabsorbable sugars used as artificial sweeteners in chewing gum and other sugar-free products — can cause diarrhea in some otherwise healthy people.
Surgery. Partial intestine or gallbladder removal surgeries can sometimes cause diarrhea.
Other digestive disorders. Chronic diarrhea has a number of other causes, such as IBS, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, microscopic colitis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)."
endometriosis,"The exact cause of endometriosis isn't clear. But some possible causes include:

Retrograde menstruation. This is when menstrual blood flows back through the fallopian tubes and into the pelvic cavity instead of out of the body. The blood contains endometrial cells from the inner lining of the uterus. These cells may stick to the pelvic walls and surfaces of pelvic organs. There, they might grow and continue to thicken and bleed over the course of each menstrual cycle.
Transformed peritoneal cells. Experts suggest that hormones or immune factors might help transform cells that line the inner side of the abdomen, called peritoneal cells, into cells that are like those that line the inside of the uterus.
Embryonic cell changes. Hormones such as estrogen may transform embryonic cells — cells in the earliest stages of development — into endometrial-like cell growths during puberty.
Surgical scar complication. Endometrial cells may attach to scar tissue from a cut made during surgery to the stomach area, such as a C-section.
Endometrial cell transport. The blood vessels or tissue fluid system may move endometrial cells to other parts of the body.
Immune system condition. A problem with the immune system may make the body unable to recognize and destroy endometriosis tissue."
epilepsy,"Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including:

Genetic influence. Some types of epilepsy run in families. In these instances, it's likely that there's a genetic influence. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes. But some people have genetic epilepsy that isn't hereditary. Genetic changes can occur in a child without being passed down from a parent.

For most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures.

Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy.
Factors in the brain. Brain tumors can cause epilepsy. Epilepsy also may be caused by the way blood vessels form in the brain. People with blood vessel conditions such as arteriovenous malformations and cavernous malformations can have seizures. And in adults older than age 35, stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy.
Infections. Meningitis, HIV, viral encephalitis and some parasitic infections can cause epilepsy.
Injury before birth. Before they're born, babies are sensitive to brain damage that could be caused by several factors. They might include an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or not enough oxygen. This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy.
Developmental conditions. Epilepsy can sometimes occur with developmental conditions. People with autism are more likely to have epilepsy than are people without autism. Research also has found that people with epilepsy are more likely to have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other developmental conditions. Having both conditions may be related to genes."
fever,"Typical body temperature is a balance of heat production and heat loss. An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs) — also known as your body's ""thermostat"" — monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.

When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.

Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.

Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:

A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis — inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine"
fibromyalgia,"Many researchers believe that repeated nerve stimulation causes the brain and spinal cord of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain.

In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become sensitized, meaning they can overreact to painful and nonpainful signals.

There are likely many factors that lead to these changes, including:

Genetics. Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder.
Infections. Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia.
Physical or emotional events. Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical event, such as a car accident. Prolonged psychological stress may also trigger the condition."
gallstones,"It's not clear what causes gallstones to form. Doctors think gallstones may result when:

Your bile contains too much cholesterol. Normally, your bile contains enough chemicals to dissolve the cholesterol excreted by your liver. But if your liver excretes more cholesterol than your bile can dissolve, the excess cholesterol may form into crystals and eventually into stones.
Your bile contains too much bilirubin. Bilirubin is a chemical that's produced when your body breaks down red blood cells. Certain conditions cause your liver to make too much bilirubin, including liver cirrhosis, biliary tract infections and certain blood disorders. The excess bilirubin contributes to gallstone formation.
Your gallbladder doesn't empty correctly. If your gallbladder doesn't empty completely or often enough, bile may become very concentrated, contributing to the formation of gallstones."
GERD,"GERD, or gastroesophageal reflux disease, is a condition commonly associated with acid reflux, which occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) does not function properly.

The LES is a circular muscle at the bottom of the esophagus that opens to allow food and liquids to pass into the stomach and closes to prevent backflow. When the LES weakens or fails to close correctly, stomach contents, including digestive acids, can flow back into the esophagus, causing discomfort and inflammation.

Factors Affecting LES Function
Several factors can interfere with the proper functioning of the LES, including:

Hiatal hernia: This occurs when part of the stomach moves above the diaphragm, weakening its ability to support the LES.
Overeating: Consuming large meals can stretch the stomach, reducing the pressure on the LES and allowing reflux.
Lying down after eating: This position can reduce the pressure needed for the LES to stay closed.
Additional Contributing Factors
Certain lifestyle habits and health conditions can increase the risk of GERD or worsen symptoms:

Lifestyle factors:

Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke
Eating large meals close to bedtime
Frequent use of NSAIDs like aspirin and ibuprofen
Health factors:

Obesity
Pregnancy
Connective tissue disorders
Aging
Other health conditions:

Anxiety
Asthma
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
Pregnancy
The Role of Alcohol
Research shows that alcohol can exacerbate GERD, with higher consumption levels linked to increased risk. Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake may help improve symptoms.

Dietary Triggers
Certain foods and beverages are more likely to provoke GERD symptoms, such as:

High-fat foods, including fried and fast foods
Spicy dishes
Acidic fruits and vegetables, like citrus, tomatoes, and pineapple
Drinks like coffee, tea, and carbonated beverages
Managing GERD typically involves lifestyle adjustments, such as avoiding trigger foods, maintaining a healthy weight, and reducing alcohol consumption, to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life."
heart attack,"Coronary artery disease causes most heart attacks. In coronary artery disease, one or more of the heart (coronary) arteries are blocked. This is usually due to cholesterol-containing deposits called plaques. Plaques can narrow the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart.

If a plaque breaks open, it can cause a blood clot in the heart.

A heart attack may be caused by a complete or partial blockage of a heart (coronary) artery. One way to classify heart attacks is whether an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) shows some specific changes (ST elevation) that require emergency invasive treatment. Your health care provider may use electrocardiogram (ECG) results to describe these types of heart attacks.

An acute complete blockage of a medium or large heart artery usually means you've had an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
A partial blockage often means you've had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). However, some people with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) have a total blockage.
Not all heart attacks are caused by blocked arteries. Other causes include:

Coronary artery spasm. This is a severe squeezing of a blood vessel that's not blocked. The artery generally has cholesterol plaques or there is early hardening of the vessel due to smoking or other risk factors. Other names for coronary artery spasms are Prinzmetal's angina, vasospastic angina or variant angina.
Certain infections. COVID-19 and other viral infections may cause damage to the heart muscle.
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). This life-threatening condition is caused by a tear inside a heart artery."
hemorrhoids,"The veins around the anus tend to stretch under pressure and may bulge or swell. Hemorrhoids can develop from increased pressure in the lower rectum due to:

Straining during bowel movements.
Sitting for long periods of time, especially on the toilet.
Having chronic diarrhea or constipation.
Being obese.
Being pregnant.
Having anal intercourse.
Eating a low-fiber diet.
Regularly lifting heavy items."
hepatitis A,"Hepatitis A is caused by a virus that infects liver cells and causes inflammation. The inflammation can affect how your liver works and cause other symptoms of hepatitis A.

The virus spreads when infected stool, even just tiny amounts, enters the mouth of another person (fecal-oral transmission). You may get hepatitis A when you eat or drink something contaminated with infected stool. You may also get the infection through close contact with a person who has hepatitis A. The virus can live on surfaces for a few months. The virus does not spread through casual contact or by sneezing or coughing.

Here are some of the specific ways the hepatitis A virus can spread:

Eating food handled by someone with the virus who doesn't thoroughly wash hands after using the toilet
Drinking contaminated water
Eating food washed in contaminated water
Eating raw shellfish from water polluted with sewage
Being in close contact with a person who has the virus — even if that person has no symptoms
Having sexual contact with someone who has the virus"
hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The virus passes from person to person through blood, semen or other body fluids. It does not spread by sneezing or coughing.

Common ways that HBV can spread are:

Sexual contact. You may get hepatitis B if you have sex with someone who is infected and you don't use a condom. The virus can pass to you if the person's blood, saliva, semen or vaginal fluids enter your body.
Sharing of needles. HBV easily spreads through needles and syringes that are tainted with infected blood. Sharing equipment used to inject illicit drugs puts you at high risk of hepatitis B.
Accidental needlesticks. Hepatitis B is a concern for healthcare workers and anyone else who comes in contact with human blood.
Pregnant person to newborn. Pregnant people infected with HBV can pass the virus to their babies during childbirth. But the newborn can be vaccinated to prevent getting infected in almost all cases. Talk with your healthcare professional about being tested for hepatitis B if you are pregnant or want to become pregnant."
hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C infection is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The infection spreads when blood that has the virus enters the bloodstream of a person who isn't affected.

Around the world, hepatitis C infection exists in several forms, called genotypes. There are seven genotypes and 67 subtypes. The most common hepatitis C genotype in the United States is type 1.

Chronic hepatitis C follows the same course no matter what the genotype of the infecting virus. But treatment can vary depending on viral genotype. However, newer antiviral drugs can treat many genotypes."
hernia,"Hernias occur due to a combination of muscle weakness and strain, and their development can be either rapid or gradual depending on the cause.

Common causes of muscle weakness or strain that may lead to a hernia include:

Congenital conditions present from birth due to developmental issues in the womb
Aging
Injuries or complications from surgery
Intense physical activity or heavy lifting
Persistent coughing or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Pregnancy, particularly with multiple pregnancies
Constipation, causing straining during bowel movements
Being overweight or obese
Abdominal fluid buildup (ascites)
Additionally, certain factors increase the risk of hernia development, such as:

Premature birth or low birth weight
Older age
Chronic coughing (due to repeated pressure on the abdomen)
Cystic fibrosis
Pregnancy
Persistent constipation
Excess weight or obesity
Smoking, which weakens connective tissues
A personal or family history of hernias"
HIV,"HIV is caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact, shooting of illicit drugs or use of shared needles, and contact with infected blood. It also can spread from parent to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.

HIV destroys white blood cells called CD4 T cells. These cells play a large role in helping the body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes."
hives,"When you experience an allergic reaction to a substance, your body releases histamine and other chemicals into the bloodstream, leading to symptoms such as itching, swelling, and other discomforts. Hives are a common result of such reactions, particularly among individuals with other allergies like hay fever.

Angioedema, which is swelling in deeper layers of tissue, can sometimes accompany hives. It can occur anywhere on the body but is especially concerning when it affects the mouth or throat, as it may cause severe symptoms like airway obstruction.

Various substances can trigger hives, including:

Animal dander (especially from cats)
Insect bites
Medications
Pollen
Foods such as shellfish, fish, nuts, eggs, and milk"
kidney stones,"Kidney stones often have no definite, single cause, although several factors may increase your risk.

Kidney stones form when your urine contains more crystal-forming substances — such as calcium, oxalate and uric acid — than the fluid in your urine can dilute. At the same time, your urine may lack substances that prevent crystals from sticking together, creating an ideal environment for kidney stones to form.

Types of kidney stones
Knowing the type of kidney stone you have helps determine its cause, and may give clues on how to reduce your risk of getting more kidney stones. If possible, try to save your kidney stone if you pass one so that you can bring it to your doctor for analysis.

Types of kidney stones include:

Calcium stones. Most kidney stones are calcium stones, usually in the form of calcium oxalate. Oxalate is a substance made daily by your liver or absorbed from your diet. Certain fruits and vegetables, as well as nuts and chocolate, have high oxalate content.

Dietary factors, high doses of vitamin D, intestinal bypass surgery and several metabolic disorders can increase the concentration of calcium or oxalate in urine.

Calcium stones may also occur in the form of calcium phosphate. This type of stone is more common in metabolic conditions, such as renal tubular acidosis. It may also be associated with certain medications used to treat migraines or seizures, such as topiramate (Topamax, Trokendi XR, Qudexy XR).

Struvite stones. Struvite stones form in response to a urinary tract infection. These stones can grow quickly and become quite large, sometimes with few symptoms or little warning.
Uric acid stones. Uric acid stones can form in people who lose too much fluid because of chronic diarrhea or malabsorption, those who eat a high-protein diet, and those with diabetes or metabolic syndrome. Certain genetic factors also may increase your risk of uric acid stones.
Cystine stones. These stones form in people with a hereditary disorder called cystinuria that causes the kidneys to excrete too much of a specific amino acid."
obesity,"Although there are genetic, behavioral, metabolic and hormonal influences on body weight, obesity occurs when you take in more calories than you burn through typical daily activities and exercise. Your body stores these excess calories as fat.

In the United States, most people's diets are too high in calories — often from fast food and high-calorie beverages. People with obesity might eat more calories before feeling full, feel hungry sooner, or eat more due to stress or anxiety.

Many people who live in Western countries now have jobs that are much less physically demanding, so they don't tend to burn as many calories at work. Even daily activities use fewer calories, courtesy of conveniences such as remote controls, escalators, online shopping, and drive-through restaurants and banks."
osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage that cushions the ends of bones in your joints gradually deteriorates. Cartilage is a firm, slippery tissue that enables nearly frictionless joint motion.

Eventually, if the cartilage wears down completely, bone will rub on bone.

Osteoarthritis has often been referred to as a wear and tear disease. But besides the breakdown of cartilage, osteoarthritis affects the entire joint. It causes changes in the bone and deterioration of the connective tissues that hold the joint together and attach muscle to bone. It also causes inflammation of the joint lining."
osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease and significantly increases the risk of fractures. Approximately half of women over the age of 50 will experience a fracture of the hip, wrist, or spine during their lifetime, with spine fractures being the most prevalent.

Calcium and phosphate are vital minerals required for building and maintaining strong, healthy bones. Throughout life, your body continually breaks down old bone and forms new bone. When this process is balanced, bones remain strong. However, when the body reabsorbs more bone than it creates, bone loss occurs. In some cases, this happens without a known cause, while in others, it may run in families. Bone loss is most common in older white women.

Brittle and fragile bones can develop when the body reabsorbs too much bone or fails to produce enough new bone. Aging can lead to the reabsorption of calcium and phosphate from bones, weakening them.

A major risk factor is insufficient calcium intake, which prevents the creation of new bone tissue. Consuming calcium-rich foods and getting enough vitamin D are essential, as vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium. Bones may become brittle and prone to fractures if:

You do not consume enough calcium and vitamin D.
Your body fails to absorb enough calcium and vitamin D, such as after gastric bypass surgery or due to certain medical conditions.
Other factors contributing to bone loss include:

Reduced estrogen levels in women during menopause and decreased testosterone levels in aging men.
Prolonged bed rest due to illness, which primarily affects children.
Medical conditions causing increased inflammation, such as Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis.
Certain medications, including seizure medications, hormone therapies for prostate or breast cancer, and long-term steroid use (over three months)."
Parkinson's disease,"In Parkinson's disease, nerve cells in the brain called neurons slowly break down or die. Many Parkinson's disease symptoms are caused by a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in the brain. This messenger is called dopamine.

Decreased dopamine leads to irregular brain activity. This causes movement problems and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease. People with Parkinson's disease also lose a chemical messenger called norepinephrine that controls many body functions, such as blood pressure.

The cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but several factors seem to play a role, including:

Genes. Specific genetic changes are linked to Parkinson's disease. But these are rare unless many family members have had Parkinson's disease.
Environmental factors. Exposure to certain toxins or other environmental factors may increase the risk of later Parkinson's disease. One example is MPTP, a substance that can be found in illegal drugs and is sometimes sold illegally as ""synthetic heroin."" Other examples include pesticides and well water used for drinking. But no environmental factor has proved to be a cause.
Many changes happen in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease. Researchers are studying why the changes happen and the roles they play. These changes include:

The presence of Lewy bodies. Clumps of proteins in the brain are associated with Parkinson's disease. These are called Lewy bodies, and researchers believe these proteins hold an important clue to the cause of Parkinson's disease.
Alpha-synuclein found within Lewy bodies. Alpha-synuclein is a protein found in all Lewy bodies. It occurs in a clumped form that cells can't break down. This is currently an important focus among Parkinson's disease researchers. Alpha-synuclein has been found in the spinal fluid of people who later have Parkinson's disease.
Altered mitochondria. Mitochondria are powerhouse compartments inside cells that create most of the body's energy. Changes to mitochondria can cause cell damage. These changes have been found in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease."
psoriatic arthritis,"Psoriatic arthritis occurs when your body's immune system attacks healthy cells and tissue. The immune response causes inflammation in your joints as well as overproduction of skin cells.

It seems likely that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in this immune system response. Many people with psoriatic arthritis have a family history of either psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. Researchers have discovered certain genetic markers that appear to be associated with psoriatic arthritis.

Physical trauma or something in the environment — such as a viral or bacterial infection — might trigger psoriatic arthritis in people with an inherited tendency."
cirrhosis,"A wide range of diseases and conditions can damage the liver and lead to cirrhosis.

Some of the causes include:

Long-term alcohol abuse.
Ongoing viral hepatitis (hepatitis B, C and D).
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a condition in which fat accumulates in the liver.
Hemochromatosis, a condition that causes iron buildup in the body.
Autoimmune hepatitis, which is a liver disease caused by the body's immune system.
Destruction of the bile ducts caused by primary biliary cholangitis.
Hardening and scarring of the bile ducts caused by primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Wilson's disease, a condition in which copper accumulates in the liver.
Cystic fibrosis.
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
Poorly formed bile ducts, a condition known as biliary atresia.
Inherited disorders of sugar metabolism, such as galactosemia or glycogen storage disease.
Alagille syndrome, a genetic digestive disorder.
Infection, such as syphilis or brucellosis.
Medications, including methotrexate or isoniazid."
delirium,"Delirium occurs when signals in the brain aren't sent and received properly.

The disorder may have a single cause or more than one cause. For example, a medical condition combined with the side effects of a medicine could cause delirium. Sometimes no cause can be found. Possible causes include:

Certain medicines or medicine side effects
Alcohol or drug use or withdrawal
A medical condition such as a stroke, heart attack, worsening lung or liver disease, or an injury from a fall
An imbalance in the body, such as low sodium or low calcium
Severe, long-lasting illness or an illness that will lead to death
Fever and a new infection, particularly in children
Urinary tract infection, pneumonia, the flu or COVID-19, especially in older adults
Exposure to a toxin, such as carbon monoxide, cyanide or other poisons
Poor nutrition or a loss of too much body fluid
Lack of sleep or severe emotional distress
Pain
Surgery or another medical procedure that requires being put in a sleep-like state
Some medicines taken alone or taken in combination can trigger delirium. These include medicines that treat:

Pain
Sleep problems
Mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression
Allergies
Asthma
Swelling
Parkinson's disease
Spasms or convulsions"
epilepsy,"Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including:

Genetic influence. Some types of epilepsy run in families. In these instances, it's likely that there's a genetic influence. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes. But some people have genetic epilepsy that isn't hereditary. Genetic changes can occur in a child without being passed down from a parent.

For most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures.

Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy.
Factors in the brain. Brain tumors can cause epilepsy. Epilepsy also may be caused by the way blood vessels form in the brain. People with blood vessel conditions such as arteriovenous malformations and cavernous malformations can have seizures. And in adults older than age 35, stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy.
Infections. Meningitis, HIV, viral encephalitis and some parasitic infections can cause epilepsy.
Injury before birth. Before they're born, babies are sensitive to brain damage that could be caused by several factors. They might include an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or not enough oxygen. This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy.
Developmental conditions. Epilepsy can sometimes occur with developmental conditions. People with autism are more likely to have epilepsy than are people without autism. Research also has found that people with epilepsy are more likely to have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other developmental conditions. Having both conditions may be related to genes.
Seizure triggers
Seizures can be triggered by things in the environment. Seizure triggers don't cause epilepsy, but they may trigger seizures in people who have epilepsy. Most people with epilepsy don't have reliable triggers that always cause a seizure. However, they often can identify factors that make it easier to have a seizure. Possible seizure triggers include:

Alcohol.
Flashing lights.
Illicit drug use.
Skipping doses of antiseizure medicines or taking more than prescribed.
Lack of sleep.
Hormone changes during the menstrual cycle.
Stress.
Dehydration.
Skipped meals.
Illness."
heart failure,"Heart failure can be caused by a weakened, damaged or stiff heart.

If the heart is damaged or weakened, the heart chambers may stretch and get bigger. The heart can't pump out the needed amount of blood.
If the main pumping chambers of the heart, called the ventricles, are stiff, they can't fill with enough blood between beats.
The heart muscle can be damaged by certain infections, heavy alcohol use, illegal drug use and some chemotherapy medicines. Your genes also can play a role.

Any of the following conditions also can damage or weaken the heart and cause heart failure.

Coronary artery disease and heart attack. Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure. The disease results from the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries. The deposits narrow the arteries. This reduces blood flow and can lead to heart attack.

A heart attack occurs suddenly when an artery feeding the heart becomes completely blocked. Damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack may mean that the heart can no longer pump as well as it should.

High blood pressure. Also called hypertension, this condition forces the heart to work harder than it should to pump blood through the body. Over time, the extra work can make the heart muscle too stiff or too weak to properly pump blood.
Heart valve disease. The valves of the heart keep blood flowing the right way. If a valve isn't working properly, the heart must work harder to pump blood. This can weaken the heart over time. Treating some types of heart valve problems may reverse heart failure.
Inflammation of the heart muscle, also called myocarditis. Myocarditis is most commonly caused by a virus, including the COVID-19 virus, and can lead to left-sided heart failure.
A heart problem that you're born with, also called a congenital heart defect. If the heart and its chambers or valves haven't formed correctly, the other parts of the heart have to work harder to pump blood. This may lead to heart failure.
Irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias. Irregular heart rhythms may cause the heart to beat too fast, creating extra work for the heart. A slow heartbeat also may lead to heart failure. Treating an irregular heart rhythm may reverse heart failure in some people.
Other diseases. Some long-term diseases may contribute to chronic heart failure. Examples are diabetes, HIV infection, an overactive or underactive thyroid, or a buildup of iron or protein.
Causes of sudden heart failure also include:

Allergic reactions.
Any illness that affects the whole body.
Blood clots in the lungs.
Severe infections.
Use of certain medicines.
Viruses that attack the heart muscle.
Heart failure usually begins with the lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle. This is the heart's main pumping chamber. But heart failure also can affect the right side. The lower right heart chamber is called the right ventricle. Sometimes heart failure affects both sides of the heart."
peptic ulcer,"Peptic ulcers happen when acid in the organs that food travels through, called the digestive tract, eats away at the inner surface of the stomach or small intestine. The acid can create a painful open sore that may bleed.

Your digestive tract is coated with a mucous layer that most often protects against acid. But if the amount of acid increases or the amount of mucus decreases, you could develop an ulcer.

Common causes include:

Helicobacter pylori. This germ lives in the mucous layer that covers and protects tissues that line the stomach and small intestine. The H. pylori germ often causes no problems. But it can cause swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the stomach's inner layer. When this happens, it can cause an ulcer.

It's not clear how H. pylori infection spreads. It may go from person to person by close contact, such as kissing. People also can contract H. pylori through food and water.

Regular use of certain pain relievers. Taking aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) over time can irritate or inflame the lining of the stomach and small intestine. These medicines include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox DS, others), ketoprofen and others. They do not include acetaminophen (Tylenol, others)."
urinary tract infection (UTI),"UTIs typically occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and begin to spread in the bladder. The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.

The most common UTIs occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.

Infection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.

Having sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.

Infection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina."
melanoma,"Melanoma happens when something changes healthy melanocytes into cancer cells. Melanocytes are skin cells that make pigment that gives skin its color. The pigment is called melanin.

Melanoma starts when melanocytes develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. In healthy cells, DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.

The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer.

It isn't clear what changes the DNA in skin cells and how it leads to melanoma. It's likely a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors. Still, healthcare professionals believe exposure to ultraviolet light is the leading cause of melanoma. Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, comes from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds.

UV light doesn't cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don't receive exposure to sunlight. This means that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma."
gastritis,"Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining. The stomach lining is a mucus-lined barrier that protects the stomach wall. Weaknesses or injury to the barrier allows digestive juices to damage and inflame the stomach lining. Several diseases and conditions can increase the risk of gastritis. These include inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn's disease."
glaucoma,"Glaucoma develops when the optic nerve becomes damaged. As this nerve gradually gets worse, blind spots develop in your vision. For reasons that eye doctors don't fully understand, this nerve damage is usually related to increased pressure in the eye.

Raised eye pressure happens as the result of a buildup of fluid that flows throughout the inside of the eye. This fluid, called the aqueous humor, usually drains through a tissue located at the angle where the iris and cornea meet. This tissue is called the trabecular meshwork. The cornea is important to vision because it lets light into the eye. When the eye makes too much fluid or the drainage system doesn't work properly, eye pressure may increase.

Open-angle glaucoma
This is the most common form of glaucoma. The drainage angle formed by the iris and cornea remains open. But other parts of the drainage system don't drain properly. This may lead to a slow, gradual increase in eye pressure.

Acute angle-closure glaucoma
This form of glaucoma happens when the iris bulges. The bulging iris partially or completely blocks the drainage angle. As a result, fluid can't circulate through the eye and pressure increases. Angle-closure glaucoma may happen suddenly or gradually.

Normal-tension glaucoma
No one knows the exact reason why the optic nerve becomes damaged when eye pressure is healthy. The optic nerve may be sensitive or experience less blood flow. This limited blood flow may be caused by the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries or other conditions that damage circulation. The buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries also is known as atherosclerosis.

Glaucoma in children
A child may be born with glaucoma or develop it in the first few years of life. Blocked drainage, injury or an underlying medical condition may cause optic nerve damage.

Pigmentary glaucoma
In pigmentary glaucoma, small pigment granules flake off from the iris and block or slow fluid drainage from the eye. Activities such as jogging sometimes stir up the pigment granules. That leads to a deposit of pigment granules on tissue located at the angle where the iris and cornea meet. The granule deposits cause an increase in pressure.

Glaucoma tends to run in families. In some people, scientists have identified genes related to high eye pressure and optic nerve damage."
tachycardia,"Tachycardia is an increased heart rate for any reason. If a fast heart rate is caused by exercise or stress, it's called sinus tachycardia. Sinus tachycardia is a symptom, not a condition.

Most heart conditions can lead to different forms of tachycardia. Irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias, are one cause. An example of an irregular heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AFib).

Other things that may lead to tachycardia include:

Fever.
Excessive alcohol use, which is defined as 14 or more drinks a week for a man or seven or more drinks a week for a woman.
Alcohol withdrawal.
Too much caffeine.
High or low blood pressure.
Changes in the level of minerals in the body, called electrolytes. Examples include potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium.
Certain medicines.
Overactive thyroid, called hyperthyroidism.
A low number of red blood cells, called anemia.
Smoking or nicotine use.
Use of illegal stimulants such as cocaine or methamphetamine.
Heart attack."
anemia,"Anemia occurs when the blood doesn't have enough hemoglobin or red blood cells.

This can happen if:

The body doesn't make enough hemoglobin or red blood cells.
Bleeding causes loss of red blood cells and hemoglobin faster than they can be replaced.
The body destroys red blood cells and the hemoglobin that's in them.
What red blood cells do
The body makes three types of blood cells. White blood cells fight infection, platelets help blood clot and red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body.

Red blood cells have an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color, called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin lets red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. And it lets red blood cells carry carbon dioxide from other parts of the body to the lungs to be breathed out.

Spongy matter inside many of the large bones, called bone marrow, makes red blood cells and hemoglobin. To make them, the body needs iron, vitamin B-12, folate and other nutrients from foods.

Causes of anemia
Different types of anemia have different causes. They include:

Iron deficiency anemia. Too little iron in the body causes this most common type of anemia. Bone marrow needs iron to make hemoglobin. Without enough iron, the body can't make enough hemoglobin for red blood cells.

Pregnant people can get this type of anemia if they don't take iron supplements. Blood loss also can cause it. Blood loss might be from heavy menstrual bleeding, an ulcer, cancer or regular use of some pain relievers, especially aspirin.

Vitamin deficiency anemia. Besides iron, the body needs folate and vitamin B-12 to make enough healthy red blood cells. A diet that doesn't have enough of these and other key nutrients can result in the body not making enough red blood cells.

Also, some people can't absorb vitamin B-12. This can lead to vitamin deficiency anemia, also called pernicious anemia.

Anemia of inflammation. Diseases that cause ongoing inflammation can keep the body from making enough red blood cells. Examples are cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease and Crohn's disease.
Aplastic anemia. This rare, life-threatening anemia occurs when the body doesn't make enough new blood cells. Causes of aplastic anemia include infections, certain medicines, autoimmune diseases and being in contact with toxic chemicals.
Anemias linked to bone marrow disease. Diseases such as leukemia and myelofibrosis can affect how the bone marrow makes blood. The effects of these types of diseases range from mild to life-threatening.
Hemolytic anemias. This group of anemias is from red blood cells being destroyed faster than bone marrow can replace them. Certain blood diseases increase how fast red blood cells are destroyed. Some types of hemolytic anemia can be passed through families, which is called inherited.
Sickle cell anemia. This inherited and sometimes serious condition is a type of hemolytic anemia. An unusual hemoglobin forces red blood cells into an unusual crescent shape, called a sickle. These irregular blood cells die too soon. That causes an ongoing shortage of red blood cells."
pancreatitis,"The pancreas has two major roles. It produces insulin, which helps the body manage and use sugars.

The pancreas also produces dietary juices, called enzymes, that help with digestion. The pancreas makes and stores ""turned off"" versions of the enzymes. After the pancreas sends the enzymes into the small intestine, they are ""turned on"" and break down proteins in the small intestine.

If the enzymes are turned on too soon, they can start acting like digestive juices inside the pancreas. The action can irritate, damage or destroy cells. This problem, in turn, leads to immune system responses that cause swelling and other events that affect how the pancreas works.

Several conditions can lead to acute pancreatitis, including:

Blockage in the bile duct caused by gallstones.
Heavy alcohol use.
Certain medicines.
High triglyceride levels in the blood.
High calcium levels in the blood.
Pancreas cancer.
Injuries from trauma or surgery.
Conditions that can lead to chronic pancreatitis include:

Damage from repeated acute pancreatitis.
Heavy alcohol use.
Inherited genes linked to pancreatitis.
High triglyceride levels in the blood.
High calcium levels in the blood.
Sometimes, a cause for pancreatitis is never found. This is known as idiopathic pancreatitis."
tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

People with active TB disease in the lungs or voice box can spread the disease. They release tiny droplets that carry the bacteria through the air. This can happen when they're speaking, singing, laughing, coughing or sneezing. A person can get an infection after inhaling the droplets.

The disease is more likely to spread when people spend a lot of time together in an indoor space. So the disease spreads easily in places where people live or work together for long periods. Also, the disease spreads more easily in crowded gatherings.

A person with a latent TB infection cannot pass the disease to other people. A person taking drugs to treat active TB disease usually can't pass the disease after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment.

Drug-resistant TB
Some forms of the TB bacteria have become drug resistant. This means that drugs that once cured the disease no longer work.

This happens, in part, because of naturally occurring genetic changes in bacteria. A random genetic change in a bacterium might give it some quality that makes it more likely to survive the attack of an antibiotic. If it does survive, then it can multiply.

When antibiotic drugs aren't used correctly — or drugs fail to kill all the bacteria for another reason — the conditions are ideal for more-resistant versions of the bacteria to get established and multiply. If these bacteria are passed on to other people, a new drug-resistant strain can grow over time.

Problems that can lead to such drug-resistant strains of bacteria include the following:

People didn't follow directions for taking the drugs or stopped taking the drugs.
They weren't prescribed the right treatment plan.
Drugs were not available.
The drugs were of poor quality.
The body didn't absorb the drugs as expected."
chickenpox,"Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, a member of the herpesvirus family. This same virus can later cause shingles in adults.

Chickenpox is highly contagious and can spread from 1 to 2 days before the blisters appear until all the blisters have crusted over. You can catch chickenpox through:

Direct contact with the fluid from a chickenpox blister.
Breathing in droplets when someone with the disease coughs or sneezes nearby.
Most cases occur in children under the age of 10 and are usually mild. However, adults and older children often experience more severe symptoms.

Infants whose mothers have had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine are less likely to contract the disease before their first birthday. If they do, they usually experience mild symptoms, as maternal antibodies passed through the bloodstream offer some protection. Conversely, infants under 1 year old whose mothers have not had chickenpox or the vaccine are at higher risk of severe illness.

Severe cases of chickenpox are more common in children with weakened immune systems."
mumps,"Mumps is caused by a type of germ called a virus. When someone has mumps, the virus is in saliva. Coughing or sneezing can release tiny droplets with the virus into the air.

You can get the virus by breathing in tiny droplets. Or you can get the virus by touching a surface where droplets have landed and then touching your face. You also can pick up the virus from direct contact, such as kissing or sharing a water bottle.

Outbreaks in the United States most often happen where people live or work in close contact. These may include college campuses, summer camps and schools."
tetanus,"The bacterium that causes tetanus is called Clostridium tetani. The bacterium can survive in a dormant state in soil and animal feces. It's essentially shut down until it discovers a place to thrive.

When the dormant bacteria enter a wound — a condition good for growth — the cells are ""awakened."" As they are growing and dividing, they release a toxin called tetanospasmin. The toxin impairs the nerves in the body that control muscles."
polio,"Polio is caused by the poliovirus. It mainly targets nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain stem that control muscle movement. Nerve cells controlling sensation are generally not affected.

The naturally-occurring poliovirus, called the wild-type poliovirus, has been eliminated in most countries and causes few cases of polio. Another version of the virus, called the vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), is more widespread and now causes most infections worldwide. VDPV exists mainly in a few countries that use an oral vaccine with a weakened poliovirus.

The weakened virus in the oral vaccine doesn't itself cause polio, and vaccinated people rarely contract VDPV. Instead, VDPV is a new version of the virus that develops within a community or region where not enough people are vaccinated.

Even though the weakened virus in the oral vaccine doesn't cause illness, it can spread. If most people in a community are vaccinated, the spread of the weakened virus is controlled. If many people aren't vaccinated, the weakened virus can move through a community for a long time. This gives the virus the chance to change, or mutate, and behave like the wild-type virus that causes illness.

Infections from VDPV have been reported in the United States. In each case, the person was either not vaccinated or had a significantly weakened immune system. One case in New York in 2022 was in a county with a lower-than-average polio vaccination rate. Samples from wastewater showed that VDPV was spreading in some communities.

Since 2000, polio vaccination in the United States has used an injected vaccine with an inactivated poliovirus that doesn't create the risk for VDPV."
lupus,"As an autoimmune disease, lupus occurs when your immune system attacks healthy tissue in your body. It's likely that lupus results from a combination of your genetics and your environment.

It appears that people with an inherited predisposition for lupus may develop the disease when they come into contact with something in the environment that can trigger lupus. The cause of lupus in most cases, however, is unknown. Some potential triggers include:

Sunlight. Exposure to the sun may bring on lupus skin lesions or trigger an internal response in susceptible people.
Infections. Having an infection can initiate lupus or cause a relapse in some people.
Medications. Lupus can be triggered by certain types of blood pressure medications, anti-seizure medications and antibiotics. People who have drug-induced lupus usually get better when they stop taking the medication. Rarely, symptoms may persist even after the drug is stopped."
hemophilia,"When a person bleeds, the body typically pools blood cells together to form a clot to stop the bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins in the blood that work with cells known as platelets to form clots. Hemophilia occurs when a clotting factor is missing or levels of the clotting factor are low.

Congenital hemophilia
Hemophilia is usually inherited, meaning a person is born with the disorder (congenital). Congenital hemophilia is classified by the type of clotting factor that's low.

The most common type is hemophilia A, associated with a low level of factor 8 The next most common type is hemophilia B, associated with a low level of factor 9.

Acquired hemophilia
Some people develop hemophilia with no family history of the disorder. This is called acquired hemophilia.

Acquired hemophilia is a variety of the condition that occurs when a person's immune system attacks clotting factor 8 or 9 in the blood. It can be associated with:

Pregnancy
Autoimmune conditions
Cancer
Multiple sclerosis
Drug reactions
Hemophilia inheritance
In the most common types of hemophilia, the faulty gene is located on the X chromosome. Everyone has two sex chromosomes, one from each parent. Females inherit an X chromosome from the mother and an X chromosome from the father. Males inherit an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father.

This means that hemophilia almost always occurs in boys and is passed from mother to son through one of the mother's genes. Most women with the defective gene are carriers who have no signs or symptoms of hemophilia. But some carriers can have bleeding symptoms if their clotting factors are moderately decreased."
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS),"The cause of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is still unknown. A combination of factors may be involved, including:

Genetics. ME/CFS appears to run in some families, so some people may be born with a higher likelihood of developing the disorder.
Infections. Some people develop ME/CFS symptoms after getting better from a viral or bacterial infection.
Physical or emotional trauma. Some people report that they experienced an injury, surgery or significant emotional stress shortly before their symptoms began.
Problems with energy usage. Some people with ME/CFS have problems converting the body's fuel, primarily fats and sugars, into energy."
