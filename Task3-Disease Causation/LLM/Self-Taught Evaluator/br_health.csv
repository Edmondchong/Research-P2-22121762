diabetes,"Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes
Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.

Genes may play a role in some people. It’s also possible that a virus sets off an immune system attack.

Type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Having overweight or obesity increases your risk, too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar.

This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.

Type 1.5 diabetes
Type 1.5 is an autoimmune condition that occurs when the pancreas is attacked by your own antibodies. as in type 1. It may be genetic, but more research is needed.

Gestational diabetes
Gestational diabetes occurs as the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant person’s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy.

People who are overweight when they get pregnant or who gain too much weight during pregnancy are more likely to get gestational diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes occurs due to an attack on insulin-producing beta cells, but the exact cause is unclear. 
Type 2 diabetes is linked to lifestyle factors like being overweight or obese.
 Gestational diabetes arises due to hormonal changes in pregnancy, causing higher blood sugar.","The role of genetics and viruses in Type 1 diabetes is omitted. 
No mention of genetics in Type 2 diabetes or its familial connection.

diabetes,"Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes
Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.

Genes may play a role in some people. It’s also possible that a virus sets off an immune system attack.

Type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Having overweight or obesity increases your risk, too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar.

This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.

Type 1.5 diabetes
Type 1.5 is an autoimmune condition that occurs when the pancreas is attacked by your own antibodies. as in type 1. It may be genetic, but more research is needed.

Gestational diabetes
Gestational diabetes occurs as the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant person’s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy.

People who are overweight when they get pregnant or who gain too much weight during pregnancy are more likely to get gestational diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes happens because of autoimmune issues.

asthma,"Although asthma is especially common in children, many people don’t develop asthma until adulthood.

Health experts have not identified a specific cause of asthma. Instead, researchers believe it’s caused by a variety of factors, including:

-Genetics: If your parent or sibling has asthma, you’re more likely to develop it.
-History of viral infections: People with a history of severe viral infections during childhood, such as respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV), may be more likely to develop asthma.
-Hygiene hypothesis: When babies are not exposed to enough bacteria in their early months and years, their immune systems may not become strong enough to fight off asthma and other allergic conditions.

Many factors can also trigger asthma, causing the symptoms to worsen. Triggers for asthma can vary, and some people may be more sensitive to certain triggers than others.

The most common triggers include:

health conditions such as respiratory infections
exercise
environmental irritants
allergens

asthma,"Although asthma is especially common in children, many people don’t develop asthma until adulthood.

Health experts have not identified a specific cause of asthma. Instead, researchers believe it’s caused by a variety of factors, including:

-Genetics: If your parent or sibling has asthma, you’re more likely to develop it.
-History of viral infections: People with a history of severe viral infections during childhood, such as respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV), may be more likely to develop asthma.
-Hygiene hypothesis: When babies are not exposed to enough bacteria in their early months and years, their immune systems may not become strong enough to fight off asthma and other allergic conditions.

Many factors can also trigger asthma, causing the symptoms to worsen. Triggers for asthma can vary, and some people may be more sensitive to certain triggers than others.

The most common triggers include:

health conditions such as respiratory infections
exercise
environmental irritants
allergens
intense emotions
extreme weather conditions
pests
certain medications, including aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)",Asthma is a condition that develops due to genetic predisposition or viral infections in childhood. Common triggers are allergens and environmental irritants.,"Hygiene hypothesis is excluded. Fails to mention other triggers such as extreme weather, exercise, and medications.

gout,"The buildup of uric acid in your blood from the breakdown of purines causes gout.

Certain conditions, such as blood and metabolism disorders or dehydration, make your body produce too much uric acid.

A kidney or thyroid problem, or an inherited disorder, can make it harder for your body to remove excess uric acid.

You’re more likely to get gout if you:

are a middle-aged man or postmenopausal woman
have parents, siblings, or other family members with gout

endometriosis,"During a regular menstrual cycle, your body sheds the lining of your uterus. This allows menstrual blood to flow from your uterus through the small opening in the cervix and out through your vagina.

The exact cause of endometriosis isn’t known. There are severa theories regarding the cause, although no one theory has been scientifically proven.

One of the oldest theories is that endometriosis occurs due to a process called retrograde menstruation, which 90 percent of women experience, according to research. This happens when menstrual blood flows back through your fallopian tubes into your pelvic cavity instead of leaving your body through the vagina.

Another theory is that hormones transform the cells outside the uterus into cells similar to those lining the inside of the uterus, which are known as endometrial cells.

Others believe the condition may occur if small areas of your abdomen convert into endometrial-like tissue. This may happen because cells in your abdomen grow from embryonic cells, which can change shape and act like endometrial cells. It’s not known why this occurs.

These displaced endometrial cells may be on your pelvic walls and the surfaces of your pelvic organs, such as your bladder, ovaries, and rectum. They continue to grow, thicken, and bleed over the course of your menstrual cycle in response to the hormones of your cycle.

It’s also possible for the menstrual blood to leak into the pelvic cavity through a surgical scar, such as after a cesarean delivery, also commonly called a C-section.

Another theory is that the endometrial cells are transported out of the uterus through the lymphatic system. Still another theory purports it may be due to the immune system not working properly in destroying errant endometrial cells.

Some believe endometriosis might start in the fetal period with misplaced cell tissue that begins to respond to the hormones of puberty. This is often called Mullerian theory.

Another theory is that the endometrial cells are transported out of the uterus through the lymphatic system. Still another theory purports it may be due to the immune system not working properly in destroying errant endometrial cells.

Some believe endometriosis might start in the fetal period with misplaced cell tissue that begins to respond to the hormones of puberty. This is often called Mullerian theory.

endometriosis,"During a regular menstrual cycle, your body sheds the lining of your uterus. This allows menstrual blood to flow from your uterus through the small opening in the cervix and out through your vagina.

The exact cause of endometriosis isn’t known. There are severa theories regarding the cause, although no one theory has been scientifically proven.

One of the oldest theories is that endometriosis occurs due to a process called retrograde menstruation, which 90 percent of women experience, according to research. This happens when menstrual blood flows back through your fallopian tubes into your pelvic cavity instead of leaving your body through the vagina.

Another theory is that hormones transform the cells outside the uterus into cells similar to those lining the inside of the uterus, which are known as endometrial cells.

Others believe the condition may occur if small areas of your abdomen convert into endometrial-like tissue. This may happen because cells in your abdomen grow from embryonic cells, which can change shape and act like endometrial cells. It’s not known why this occurs.

One of the oldest theories is that endometriosis occurs due to a process called retrograde menstruation, which 90 percent of women experience, according to research. This happens when menstrual blood flows back through your fallopian tubes into your pelvic cavity instead of leaving your body through the vagina.

Another theory is that hormones transform the cells outside the uterus into cells similar to those lining the inside of the uterus, which are known as endometrial cells.

Others believe the condition may occur if small areas of your abdomen convert into endometrial-like tissue. This may happen because cells in your abdomen grow from embryonic cells, which can change shape and act like endometrial cells. It’s not known why this occurs.

These displaced endometrial cells may be on your pelvic walls and the surfaces of your pelvic organs, such as your bladder, ovaries, and rectum. They continue to grow, thicken, and bleed over the course of your menstrual cycle in response to the hormones of your cycle.

It’s also possible for the menstrual blood to leak into the pelvic cavity through a surgical scar, such as after a cesarean delivery, also commonly called a C-section.

Another theory is that the endometrial cells are transported out of the uterus through the lymphatic system. Still another theory purports it may be due to the immune system not working properly in destroying errant endometrial cells.

Some believe endometriosis might start in the fetal period with misplaced cell tissue that begins to respond to the hormones of puberty. This is often called Mullerian theory.

The development of endometriosis might also be linked to genetics or even environmental toxins.",Endometriosis occurs due to menstrual blood flowing back into the pelvic cavity.,"Does not include hormonal transformation, lymphatic transport, or immune dysfunction theories. Fails to mention genetic and environmental factors."

fibromyalgia,"Healthcare professionals and researchers do not know what causes fibromyalgia.

According to the latest research, the cause appears to involve a genetic disposition complemented by one or more triggers (such as infection, trauma, or stress).

Experts do not fully understand what causes the chronic widespread nature of fibromyalgia pain, either.

One theory is that the brain lowers the pain threshold. Sensations that were not painful before become very painful over time.

Another theory is that the brain and nerves may misinterpret or overreact to normal pain signals. They become more sensitive, to the point where they cause unnecessary or exaggerated pain. This may be due to a chemical imbalance in the brain or an abnormality in the dorsal root ganglion, which is a cluster of neurons in the spine.

Genes
Fibromyalgia often runs in families. If you have a family member with this condition, you’re at a higher risk for developing it.

Researchers think certain gene mutations may play a role. They’ve identified a few possible genes that affect the transmission of chemical pain signals between nerve cells.

Infections
A past illness could trigger fibromyalgia or make its symptoms worse. Infections that have possible links to fibromyalgia include:

flu
pneumonia
Epstein-Barr virus
gastrointestinal infections, such as those caused by the bacteria Salmonella and Shigella
Trauma
People who go through severe physical or emotional trauma may develop fibromyalgia. The condition has been linked to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Stress has been linked to hormonal changes that could contribute to fibromyalgia.",Fibromyalgia develops because of trauma or PTSD.,Omits genetic predisposition and infections. Fails to mention brain-related theories about lowered pain thresholds or chemical imbalances.
fibromyalgia,"Healthcare professionals and researchers do not know what causes fibromyalgia.

According to the latest research, the cause appears to involve a genetic disposition complemented by one or more triggers (such as infection, trauma, or stress).

Experts do not fully understand what causes the chronic widespread nature of fibromyalgia pain, either.

One theory is that the brain lowers the pain threshold. Sensations that were not painful before become very painful over time.

Another theory is that the brain and nerves may misinterpret or overreact to normal pain signals. They become more sensitive, to the point where they cause unnecessary or exaggerated pain. This may be due to a chemical imbalance in the brain or an abnormality in the dorsal root ganglion, which is a cluster of neurons in the spine.

Genes
Fibromyalgia often runs in families. If you have a family member with this condition, you’re at a higher risk for developing it.

Researchers think certain gene mutations may play a role. They’ve identified a few possible genes that affect the transmission of chemical pain signals between nerve cells.

Infections
A past illness could trigger fibromyalgia or make its symptoms worse. Infections that have possible links to fibromyalgia include:

flu
pneumonia
Epstein-Barr virus
gastrointestinal infections, such as those caused by the bacteria Salmonella and Shigella

fibromyalgia,"Healthcare professionals and researchers do not know what causes fibromyalgia.

According to the latest research, the cause appears to involve a genetic disposition complemented by one or more triggers (such as infection, trauma, or stress).

Experts do not fully understand what causes the chronic widespread nature of fibromyalgia pain, either.

One theory is that the brain lowers the pain threshold. Sensations that were not painful before become very painful over time.

Another theory is that the brain and nerves may misinterpret or overreact to normal pain signals. They become more sensitive, to the point where they cause unnecessary or exaggerated pain. This may be due to a chemical imbalance in the brain or an abnormality in the dorsal root ganglion, which is a cluster of neurons in the spine.

Genes
Fibromyalgia often runs in families. If you have a family member with this condition, you’re at a higher risk for developing it.

Researchers think certain gene mutations may play a role. They’ve identified a few possible genes that affect the transmission of chemical pain signals between nerve cells.

Infections
A past illness could trigger fibromyalgia or make its symptoms worse. Infections that have possible links to fibromyalgia include:

flu
pneumonia
Epstein-Barr virus
gastrointestinal infections, such as those caused by the bacteria Salmonella and Shigella
Trauma
People who go through severe physical or emotional trauma may develop fibromyalgia. The condition has been linked to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Cholesterol: Too much cholesterol in your bile can lead to yellow cholesterol stones, which may develop if your liver makes more cholesterol than your bile can dissolve. Approximately 4 in 5 gallstones are made from cholesterol.
Bilirubin: This chemical is produced during the normal breakdown of red blood cells. After bilirubin is created, it passes through the liver and is excreted out of the body. These hard stones are often dark brown or black and form when your gallbladder can’t break down the excess bilirubin.
Gallstones may also happen if your gallbladder fails to properly empty its bile content. This bile can become overly concentrated, causing stones to form.

GERD,"GERD commonly causes acid reflux, which may result from improper functioning of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

The LES is a circular band of muscle at the end of your esophagus. When you swallow, it relaxes and opens up to allow food and liquid to travel from your mouth to your stomach. Then, it tightens and closes again.

Acid reflux happens when your LES doesn’t tighten or close properly. This allows digestive juices and other contents of your stomach to rise up into your esophagus.

Your LES may not function properly if you:

Have a hiatal hernia: This occurs when part of your stomach moves above your diaphragm toward your chest. If your diaphragm is compromised, it may prevent your LES from functioning properly.
Frequently eat large meals: This may cause distension of the upper part of your stomach. This distension sometimes means there isn’t enough pressure on the LES, and it doesn’t close properly.
Lie down too soon after meals: This might not create enough pressure for the LES to function properly.

Other factors, including those listed below, may also contribute to having heartburn more than twice a week.

Lifestyle factors
Lifestyle factors that may contribute to persistent reflux with esophageal inflammation include:

smoking or being exposed to secondhand smoke
eating large meals before lying down
using an abundance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen
Health factors
Health factors such as the following may contribute to GERD:

obesity
pregnancy
connective tissue disorders
older age

Other conditions
Other health conditions that can worsen the symptoms of GERD include:

anxiety
pregnancy
asthma
irritable bowel syndrome

Alcohol
Studies suggest that drinking alcohol may increase the risk of GERD. The greater the quantity of alcohol and frequency of consumption, the greater the correlation.

If you’ve received a diagnosis of GERD, limiting or stopping alcohol intake may provide symptom relief.

Dietary triggers
Some foods may trigger GERD symptoms more than others, including:

high fat foods such as fried and fast foods
spicy foods

If you’ve received a diagnosis of GERD, limiting or stopping alcohol intake may provide symptom relief.

Dietary triggers
Some foods may trigger GERD symptoms more than others, including:

high fat foods such as fried and fast foods
spicy foods
certain fruits and vegetables, such as pineapple, tomato, and citrus
certain liquids, such as coffee, tea, and carbonated drinks",GERD happens when the LES is weak and stomach acid rises into the esophagus.,"Excludes contributing factors like pregnancy, connective tissue disorders, and alcohol consumption."
GERD,"GERD commonly causes acid reflux, which may result from improper functioning of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

The LES is a circular band of muscle at the end of your esophagus. When you swallow, it relaxes and opens up to allow food and liquid to travel from your mouth to your stomach. Then, it tightens and closes again.

Acid reflux happens when your LES doesn’t tighten or close properly. This allows digestive juices and other contents of your stomach to rise up into your esophagus.

Your LES may not function properly if you:

Have a hiatal hernia: This occurs when part of your stomach moves above your diaphragm toward your chest. If your diaphragm is compromised, it may prevent your LES from functioning properly.
Frequently eat large meals: This may cause distension of the upper part of your stomach. This distension sometimes means there isn’t enough pressure on the LES, and it doesn’t close properly.
Lie down too soon after meals: This might not create enough pressure for the LES to function properly.

Other factors, including those listed below, may also contribute to having heartburn more than twice a week.

Lifestyle factors
Lifestyle factors that may contribute to persistent reflux with esophageal inflammation include:

smoking or being exposed to secondhand smoke
eating large meals before lying down
using an abundance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen
Health factors

Lie down too soon after meals: This might not create enough pressure for the LES to function properly.

Other factors, including those listed below, may also contribute to having heartburn more than twice a week.

Lifestyle factors
Lifestyle factors that may contribute to persistent reflux with esophageal inflammation include:

smoking or being exposed to secondhand smoke
eating large meals before lying down
using an abundance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen
Health factors
Health factors such as the following may contribute to GERD:

obesity
pregnancy
connective tissue disorders
older age

Other conditions
Other health conditions that can worsen the symptoms of GERD include:

anxiety
pregnancy
asthma
irritable bowel syndrome

Alcohol
Studies suggest that drinking alcohol may increase the risk of GERD. The greater the quantity of alcohol and frequency of consumption, the greater the correlation.

If you’ve received a diagnosis of GERD, limiting or stopping alcohol intake may provide symptom relief.

Dietary triggers
Some foods may trigger GERD symptoms more than others, including:

high fat foods such as fried and fast foods
spicy foods
certain fruits and vegetables, such as pineapple, tomato, and citrus
certain liquids, such as coffee, tea, and carbonated drinks",GERD occurs because of acid reflux caused by spicy or fried foods.,Excludes other dietary triggers like citrus and coffee. Does not mention lifestyle or health factors.
GERD,"GERD commonly causes acid reflux, which may result from improper functioning of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

The LES is a circular band of muscle at the end of your esophagus. When you swallow, it relaxes and opens up to allow food and liquid to travel from your mouth to your stomach. Then, it tightens and closes again.

Acid reflux happens when your LES doesn’t tighten or close properly. This allows digestive juices and other contents of your stomach to rise up into your esophagus.

certain liquids, such as coffee, tea, and carbonated drinks",GERD occurs because of acid reflux caused by spicy foods or carbonated drinks.,Excludes other dietary triggers like high-fat foods or citrus. Omits lifestyle factors like smoking.
GERD,"GERD commonly causes acid reflux, which may result from improper functioning of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

The LES is a circular band of muscle at the end of your esophagus. When you swallow, it relaxes and opens up to allow food and liquid to travel from your mouth to your stomach. Then, it tightens and closes again.

Acid reflux happens when your LES doesn’t tighten or close properly. This allows digestive juices and other contents of your stomach to rise up into your esophagus.

Your LES may not function properly if you:

Have a hiatal hernia: This occurs when part of your stomach moves above your diaphragm toward your chest. If your diaphragm is compromised, it may prevent your LES from functioning properly.
Frequently eat large meals: This may cause distension of the upper part of your stomach. This distension sometimes means there isn’t enough pressure on the LES, and it doesn’t close properly.
Lie down too soon after meals: This might not create enough pressure for the LES to function properly.

Other factors, including those listed below, may also contribute to having heartburn more than twice a week.

Lifestyle factors
Lifestyle factors that may contribute to persistent reflux with esophageal inflammation include:

smoking or being exposed to secondhand smoke
eating large meals before lying down
using an abundance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen
Health factors
Health factors such as the following may contribute to GERD:

obesity
pregnancy
connective tissue disorders
older age

Other conditions
Other health conditions that can worsen the symptoms of GERD include:

anxiety
pregnancy
asthma
irritable bowel syndrome

Alcohol
Studies suggest that drinking alcohol may increase the risk of GERD. The greater the quantity of alcohol and frequency of consumption, the greater the correlation.

If you’ve received a diagnosis of GERD, limiting or stopping alcohol intake may provide symptom relief.

Dietary triggers
Some foods may trigger GERD symptoms more than others, including:

high fat foods such as fried and fast foods
spicy foods
certain fruits and vegetables, such as pineapple, tomato, and citrus
certain liquids, such as coffee, tea, and carbonated drinks",GERD results from weak LES function and eating large meals.,"Fails to include dietary triggers, alcohol, or health factors like pregnancy."

heart attack,"The leading cause of heart attacks is coronary heart disease. This is where plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. The general buildup of plaque in the arteries is also known as atherosclerosis.

There are two main types of heart attack.

Type I heart attacks are where plaque on the inner wall of the artery ruptures and releases cholesterol and other substances into the bloodstream. This can then form a blood clot and block the artery.

In type II heart attacks the heart does not receive as much oxygen-rich blood as it needs, but there is not a complete blockage of an artery.

Other causes of heart attacks include:

torn blood vessels
blood vessel spasms
drug misuse
hypoxia, lack of oxygen in the blood",Heart attacks are caused by a blockage in the arteries.,"Does not distinguish between type I and type II heart attacks. Omits other causes like torn blood vessels, spasms, and hypoxia."

heart attack,"The leading cause of heart attacks is coronary heart disease. This is where plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. The general buildup of plaque in the arteries is also known as atherosclerosis.

There are two main types of heart attack.

Type I heart attacks are where plaque on the inner wall of the artery ruptures and releases cholesterol and other substances into the bloodstream. This can then form a blood clot and block the artery.

In type II heart attacks the heart does not receive as much oxygen-rich blood as it needs, but there is not a complete blockage of an artery.

Other causes of heart attacks include:

torn blood vessels
blood vessel spasms
drug misuse
hypoxia, lack of oxygen in the blood",Blocked arteries from plaque buildup lead to heart attacks.,Omits type II heart attacks and other causes like torn blood vessels and hypoxia.

In addition to transmission from eating food or drinking water containing HAV, the virus can also be spread by close personal contact with someone who already has it. HAV is contagious, and a person who has hepatitis A can easily pass the disease to others living in the same household.

You can contract hepatitis A by:

eating food prepared by someone with the hepatitis A virus
eating food handled by preparers who don’t follow strict hand-washing routines before touching food that you eat
eating sewage-contaminated raw shellfish
having sex with someone who has the hepatitis A virus
drinking polluted water
coming in contact with hepatitis A-infected fecal matter",Hepatitis A is caused by drinking sewage-contaminated water.,"Does not include food contamination, raw shellfish, or sexual contact as causes."

obesity,"Taking in more calories than you burn in daily activity and exercise — on a long-term basis — can lead to obesity. Over time, these extra calories add up and cause weight gain.

But it’s not always just about calories in and calories out or having a sedentary lifestyle. While those are indeed causes of obesity, some causes you can’t control.

Common specific causes of obesity include:

genetics, which can affect how your body processes food into energy and how fat is stored
growing older, which can lead to less muscle mass and a slower metabolic rate, making it easier to gain weight
not sleeping enough, which can lead to hormonal changes that make you feel hungrier and crave certain high calorie foods
high stress, which may trigger the production of hormones that cause you to eat more and store more fat
pregnancy, as weight gained during pregnancy may be difficult to lose and might eventually lead to obesity
Certain health conditions can also lead to weight gain, which may lead to obesity. These include:

metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors that include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high levels of triglycerides, low levels of HDL cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist that raise your chance of developing certain serious health conditions
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition that causes an imbalance of hormones called androgens
Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare condition present at birth that causes excessive hunger
Cushing syndrome, a condition caused by having high levels of cortisol (the stress hormone) in your system
hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough of certain important hormones
osteoarthritis (OA) and other conditions that cause pain that may lead to reduced activity",Obesity is caused by consuming more calories than you burn.,"Does not include other factors like genetics, medical conditions, or hormonal changes."

obesity,"Taking in more calories than you burn in daily activity and exercise — on a long-term basis — can lead to obesity. Over time, these extra calories add up and cause weight gain.

But it’s not always just about calories in and calories out or having a sedentary lifestyle. While those are indeed causes of obesity, some causes you can’t control.

Common specific causes of obesity include:

genetics, which can affect how your body processes food into energy and how fat is stored
growing older, which can lead to less muscle mass and a slower metabolic rate, making it easier to gain weight
not sleeping enough, which can lead to hormonal changes that make you feel hungrier and crave certain high calorie foods
high stress, which may trigger the production of hormones that cause you to eat more and store more fat
pregnancy, as weight gained during pregnancy may be difficult to lose and might eventually lead to obesity
Certain health conditions can also lead to weight gain, which may lead to obesity. These include:

metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors that include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high levels of triglycerides, low levels of HDL cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist that raise your chance of developing certain serious health conditions

obesity,"Taking in more calories than you burn in daily activity and exercise — on a long-term basis — can lead to obesity. Over time, these extra calories add up and cause weight gain.

But it’s not always just about calories in and calories out or having a sedentary lifestyle. While those are indeed causes of obesity, some causes you can’t control.

Common specific causes of obesity include:

genetics, which can affect how your body processes food into energy and how fat is stored
growing older, which can lead to less muscle mass and a slower metabolic rate, making it easier to gain weight
not sleeping enough, which can lead to hormonal changes that make you feel hungrier and crave certain high calorie foods
high stress, which may trigger the production of hormones that cause you to eat more and store more fat
pregnancy, as weight gained during pregnancy may be difficult to lose and might eventually lead to obesity
Certain health conditions can also lead to weight gain, which may lead to obesity. These include:

metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors that include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high levels of triglycerides, low levels of HDL cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist that raise your chance of developing certain serious health conditions
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition that causes an imbalance of hormones called androgens

osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis is caused by gradual joint and cartilage damage.

Cartilage is a tough, rubbery substance that protects the ends of bones within a joint, allowing them to move easily against each other. With osteoarthritis, this cartilage breaks down over time, leading to bones rubbing against each other. This may cause intense pain and other osteoarthritis symptoms.

Researchers don’t yet know the underlying cause of this gradual joint degeneration, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.

However, several osteoarthritis risk factors have been identified, which may contribute to the development and progression of the condition. These may include:

genetics, such as having a family member with the condition
past injuries, such as torn cartilage, dislocated joints, or ligament injuries
being age 50 years and older
being assigned female at birth
having overweight or obesity
having gone through menopause

osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease, significantly increasing the likelihood of fractures. Around half of women over 50 will suffer a fracture in the hip, wrist, or spine during their lifetime, with spine fractures being the most frequent.

To build and maintain strong bones, the body relies on calcium and phosphate. Throughout life, bones undergo a continuous process of breakdown and renewal. As long as this process remains balanced, bones stay strong. However, bone loss occurs when the body reabsorbs more bone than it produces. In some cases, this happens without an identifiable cause, while in others, it may run in families. Older white women are particularly at risk for bone loss.

Weak, brittle bones result from the body absorbing too much bone or failing to produce sufficient new bone. Aging can also lead to the loss of calcium and phosphate from bones, further weakening them.

A major factor in preventing bone loss is consuming enough calcium to support bone formation. It’s crucial to eat calcium-rich foods and get sufficient vitamin D, which aids in calcium absorption. Bones can become fragile and more prone to fractures if:

You don’t consume enough calcium and vitamin D.
Your body cannot effectively absorb calcium and vitamin D, which can occur after gastric bypass surgery or due to specific medical conditions.

Other causes of bone loss include:

Decreased estrogen in women after menopause and reduced testosterone in aging men.
Prolonged bed rest due to illness, particularly affecting children’s bones.
Chronic inflammatory conditions like Crohn’s disease or rheumatoid arthritis.
Certain medications, including seizure drugs, hormone therapies for prostate or breast cancer, and long-term use of steroids (over three months).",Osteoporosis occurs due to aging.,"Does not mention other causes like decreased estrogen, vitamin D deficiency, or chronic inflammatory conditions."

Other causes of bone loss include:

Decreased estrogen in women after menopause and reduced testosterone in aging men.
Prolonged bed rest due to illness, particularly affecting children’s bones.
Chronic inflammatory conditions like Crohn’s disease or rheumatoid arthritis.
Certain medications, including seizure drugs, hormone therapies for prostate or breast cancer, and long-term use of steroids (over three months).",Aging is the main cause of osteoporosis.,"Does not mention hormonal changes, calcium and vitamin D deficiencies, or chronic conditions."
osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease, significantly increasing the likelihood of fractures. Around half of women over 50 will suffer a fracture in the hip, wrist, or spine during their lifetime, with spine fractures being the most frequent.

To build and maintain strong bones, the body relies on calcium and phosphate. Throughout life, bones undergo a continuous process of breakdown and renewal. As long as this process remains balanced, bones stay strong. However, bone loss occurs when the body reabsorbs more bone than it produces. In some cases, this happens without an identifiable cause, while in others, it may run in families. Older white women are particularly at risk for bone loss.

Weak, brittle bones result from the body absorbing too much bone or failing to produce sufficient new bone. Aging can also lead to the loss of calcium and phosphate from bones, further weakening them.

A major factor in preventing bone loss is consuming enough calcium to support bone formation. It’s crucial to eat calcium-rich foods and get sufficient vitamin D, which aids in calcium absorption. Bones can become fragile and more prone to fractures if:

Your body cannot effectively absorb calcium and vitamin D, which can occur after gastric bypass surgery or due to specific medical conditions.

Other causes of bone loss include:

Decreased estrogen in women after menopause and reduced testosterone in aging men.
Prolonged bed rest due to illness, particularly affecting children’s bones.
Chronic inflammatory conditions like Crohn’s disease or rheumatoid arthritis.
Certain medications, including seizure drugs, hormone therapies for prostate or breast cancer, and long-term use of steroids (over three months).",Osteoporosis occurs because of a lack of calcium in the diet.,"Does not include other factors like aging, hormonal changes, or chronic inflammatory diseases."
osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease, significantly increasing the likelihood of fractures. Around half of women over 50 will suffer a fracture in the hip, wrist, or spine during their lifetime, with spine fractures being the most frequent.

To build and maintain strong bones, the body relies on calcium and phosphate. Throughout life, bones undergo a continuous process of breakdown and renewal. As long as this process remains balanced, bones stay strong. However, bone loss occurs when the body reabsorbs more bone than it produces. In some cases, this happens without an identifiable cause, while in others, it may run in families. Older white women are particularly at risk for bone loss.

Weak, brittle bones result from the body absorbing too much bone or failing to produce sufficient new bone. Aging can also lead to the loss of calcium and phosphate from bones, further weakening them.

Parkinson's disease,"The exact cause of Parkinson’s is unknown. It may have both genetic and environmental components. Some scientists believe that viruses can trigger Parkinson’s as well.

Low levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, a substance that regulates dopamine, have been linked with Parkinson’s.

Abnormal proteins called Lewy bodies have also been found in the brains of people with Parkinson’s. Scientists do not know what role, if any, Lewy bodies play in the development of Parkinson’s.

While there’s no known cause, research has identified groups of people who are more likely to develop the condition, which include:

Sex. Men are one and a half times more likely to develop Parkinson’s than women.
Race. According to research, there’s a higher prevalence of Parkinson’s in white people compared with Black or Asian people. Geographic location may be one reason for a higher risk.
Age. Parkinson’s usually appears between ages 50 and 60 years. It only occurs before 40 years old in about four percent of cases.
Family history. People who have close family members with Parkinson’s disease are more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease.

heart failure,"Heart failure happens when your heart muscle gets weak or stiff. This may then block or reduce blood flow to the heart.

The most common cause of heart failure is coronary artery disease (CAD). It happens when fatty deposits build up in your arteries, reducing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

Other conditions that may increase your risk of developing heart failure include:

heart attack
inherited heart disease
a condition that weakens the heart muscle, like cardiomyopathy
heart inflammation, like myocarditis
high blood pressure, also called hypertension
arrhythmia, which is an irregular heart rhythm
viral infection
congenital heart disease
diabetes
obesity
pressure in your lungs, called pulmonary hypertension

peptic ulcer,"Normally, the lining of the stomach and small intestines can protect itself against strong stomach acids. But if the lining breaks down, the result may be:

Swollen and inflamed tissue (gastritis)
An ulcer

Most ulcers occur in the first, inner surface, layer of the inner lining. A hole in the stomach or duodenum is called a perforation. This is a medical emergency.

The most common cause of ulcers is infection of the stomach by bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H pylori). Most people with peptic ulcers have these bacteria living in their digestive tract. Yet, many people who have these bacteria in their stomach do not develop an ulcer.

The following factors raise your risk for peptic ulcers:

Drinking too much alcohol
Regular use of aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco
Being very ill, such as being on a breathing machine
Radiation treatments

melanoma,"Melanoma develops when healthy melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells that give skin its color, transform into cancer cells. This pigment is called melanin.

Melanoma begins when the DNA of melanocytes undergoes changes. DNA contains the instructions that guide a cell's behavior. In healthy cells, DNA directs growth and division at a controlled pace and signals when cells should die. In cancer cells, changes in the DNA provide abnormal instructions, causing cells to multiply rapidly and avoid normal cell death. This leads to an accumulation of abnormal cells.

These cancerous cells may form a mass known as a tumor, which can grow and damage healthy tissues. Over time, the cancer cells may detach and spread to other parts of the body, a process called metastasis.

The exact cause of DNA changes in melanocytes that lead to melanoma is unclear. It is likely influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. However, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, from the sun or artificial sources like tanning beds, is considered the primary cause of melanoma.

Not all melanomas are caused by UV light, especially those occurring in areas of the body not exposed to sunlight. This suggests that additional factors may also play a role in increasing the risk of melanoma.",Melanoma is caused by UV light exposure.,Omits other factors like genetic predisposition or melanomas that occur in areas not exposed to sunlight.

The exact cause of DNA changes in melanocytes that lead to melanoma is unclear. It is likely influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. However, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, from the sun or artificial sources like tanning beds, is considered the primary cause of melanoma.

melanoma,"Melanoma develops when healthy melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells that give skin its color, transform into cancer cells. This pigment is called melanin.

Melanoma begins when the DNA of melanocytes undergoes changes. DNA contains the instructions that guide a cell's behavior. In healthy cells, DNA directs growth and division at a controlled pace and signals when cells should die.

A gastrointestinal bacterial infection can also cause gastritis. The most common bacterial infection that causes it is H. pylori, a bacterium that infects the lining of the stomach. The infection is usually passed from person to person, but it can also be transmitted through contaminated food or water.

Certain conditions and activities may increase your risk for developing gastritis. Other risk factors include:

extreme alcohol consumption
routine use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen and aspirin
cocaine use
age, because the stomach lining thins naturally with age
tobacco use

glaucoma,"The back of your eye continuously makes a clear fluid called aqueous humor. As this fluid is made, it fills the front part of your eye. Then, it leaves your eye through channels in your cornea and iris. If these channels are blocked or partially obstructed, the natural pressure in your eye, which is called the intraocular pressure (IOP), may increase. As your IOP increases, your optic nerve may become damaged. As damage to your nerve progresses, you may begin losing sight in your eye.

What causes the pressure in your eye to increase isn’t always known. However, doctors believe one or more of these factors may play a role:

Many heart conditions can lead to various forms of tachycardia, often linked to irregular heart rhythms, or arrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a common example of an arrhythmia that can result in tachycardia.

Other factors that may contribute to tachycardia include:

Fever.
Excessive alcohol consumption (14 or more drinks per week for men, or 7 or more drinks per week for women).
Alcohol withdrawal.
High caffeine intake.
High or low blood pressure.
Electrolyte imbalances, such as abnormal levels of potassium, sodium, calcium, or magnesium.

anemia,"Red blood cells are produced in your bone marrow and have an average lifespan of 100 to 120 days. On average, your bone marrow produces 2 million red blood cells each second while approximately the same number are removed from circulation.

About 1 percent of your red blood cells are removed from circulation and replaced each day.

Any process that has a negative effect on this balance between red blood cell production and destruction can cause anemia.

Causes of anemia are generally divided into those that decrease red blood cell production and those that increase red blood cell destruction or loss.

Factors that decrease red blood cell production
When red blood cell production is lower than normal, more red blood cells are leaving your body than entering circulation. This can potentially lead to anemia.

Factors that decrease red blood cells production can be divided into two categories – acquired and inherited.

Acquired factors that can decrease RBC production include:

inadequate dietary intake of nutrients important for red blood cells production, such as iron, vitamin B12, or folate
kidney disease
some types of cancer, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma
autoimmune diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis
certain kinds of infections, such as HIV and tuberculosis
hypothyroidism
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) like ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease
aplastic anemia
certain types of medications or treatments, particularly chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer
exposure to toxins, such as lead
Some types of genetic (inherited) conditions are also associated with a decrease in production of healthy red blood cells. These include:

Fanconi anemia
Schwachman-Diamond syndrome
Diamond-Blackfan anemia
dyskeratosis congenita
amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia
Factors that increase red blood cell destruction or loss
On the other hand, anything that causes destruction or loss of red blood cells at a rate faster than they’re made can also cause anemia.

Factors that increase the destruction of red blood cells can also be either acquired or inherited.

Some acquired factors that may lead to increased red blood cell destruction or loss are:

blood loss, which can happen due to:
accidents or injuries
surgery
heavy menstrual bleeding
childbirth
endometriosis
gastrointestinal lesions, such as ulcers or those due to IBD or cancer
heavy nosebleeds
frequent blood donation
hemolysis, which is when red blood cells break down too soon due to things like:
autoimmune activity
certain infections
medication side effects
exposure to toxins
enlarged spleen
liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis
infections like malaria
Some inherited causes of increased red blood cell destruction can include:

Fanconi anemia
Schwachman-Diamond syndrome
Diamond-Blackfan anemia
dyskeratosis congenita
amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia
Factors that increase red blood cell destruction or loss
On the other hand, anything that causes destruction or loss of red blood cells at a rate faster than they’re made can also cause anemia.

Factors that increase the destruction of red blood cells can also be either acquired or inherited.

Some acquired factors that may lead to increased red blood cell destruction or loss are:

blood loss, which can happen due to:
accidents or injuries
surgery
heavy menstrual bleeding
childbirth
endometriosis
gastrointestinal lesions, such as ulcers or those due to IBD or cancer
heavy nosebleeds
frequent blood donation
hemolysis, which is when red blood cells break down too soon due to things like:
autoimmune activity
certain infections
medication side effects
exposure to toxins
enlarged spleen
liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis
infections like malaria
Some inherited causes of increased red blood cell destruction can include:

sickle cell disease
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency
thalassemia
pyruvate kinase deficiency
hereditary spherocytosis
hereditary elliptocytosis",Anemia occurs due to aplastic anemia.,"Fails to include other contributing factors like infections, toxins, or cancer."
anemia,"Red blood cells are produced in your bone marrow and have an average lifespan of 100 to 120 days. On average, your bone marrow produces 2 million red blood cells each second while approximately the same number are removed from circulation.

About 1 percent of your red blood cells are removed from circulation and replaced each day.

Any process that has a negative effect on this balance between red blood cell production and destruction can cause anemia.

Causes of anemia are generally divided into those that decrease red blood cell production and those that increase red blood cell destruction or loss.

Factors that decrease red blood cell production
When red blood cell production is lower than normal, more red blood cells are leaving your body than entering circulation. This can potentially lead to anemia.

Factors that decrease red blood cells production can be divided into two categories – acquired and inherited.

Acquired factors that can decrease RBC production include:

inadequate dietary intake of nutrients important for red blood cells production, such as iron, vitamin B12, or folate
kidney disease
some types of cancer, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma
autoimmune diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis

anemia,"Red blood cells are produced in your bone marrow and have an average lifespan of 100 to 120 days. On average, your bone marrow produces 2 million red blood cells each second while approximately the same number are removed from circulation.

About 1 percent of your red blood cells are removed from circulation and replaced each day.

Any process that has a negative effect on this balance between red blood cell production and destruction can cause anemia.

Causes of anemia are generally divided into those that decrease red blood cell production and those that increase red blood cell destruction or loss.

Factors that decrease red blood cell production
When red blood cell production is lower than normal, more red blood cells are leaving your body than entering circulation. This can potentially lead to anemia.

Factors that decrease red blood cells production can be divided into two categories – acquired and inherited.

Acquired factors that can decrease RBC production include:

inadequate dietary intake of nutrients important for red blood cells production, such as iron, vitamin B12, or folate
kidney disease
some types of cancer, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma
autoimmune diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis
certain kinds of infections, such as HIV and tuberculosis
hypothyroidism
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) like ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease
aplastic anemia
certain types of medications or treatments, particularly chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer
exposure to toxins, such as lead
Some types of genetic (inherited) conditions are also associated with a decrease in production of healthy red blood cells. These include:

Fanconi anemia
Schwachman-Diamond syndrome
Diamond-Blackfan anemia
dyskeratosis congenita
amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia
Factors that increase red blood cell destruction or loss
On the other hand, anything that causes destruction or loss of red blood cells at a rate faster than they’re made can also cause anemia.

Factors that increase the destruction of red blood cells can also be either acquired or inherited.

Some acquired factors that may lead to increased red blood cell destruction or loss are:

blood loss, which can happen due to:
accidents or injuries
surgery
heavy menstrual bleeding
childbirth
endometriosis
gastrointestinal lesions, such as ulcers or those due to IBD or cancer
heavy nosebleeds
frequent blood donation
hemolysis, which is when red blood cells break down too soon due to things like:
autoimmune activity
certain infections
medication side effects
exposure to toxins
enlarged spleen
liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis
infections like malaria
Some inherited causes of increased red blood cell destruction can include:

sickle cell disease
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency

Some types of genetic (inherited) conditions are also associated with a decrease in production of healthy red blood cells. These include:

Fanconi anemia
Schwachman-Diamond syndrome
Diamond-Blackfan anemia
dyskeratosis congenita
amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia
Factors that increase red blood cell destruction or loss
On the other hand, anything that causes destruction or loss of red blood cells at a rate faster than they’re made can also cause anemia.

Factors that increase the destruction of red blood cells can also be either acquired or inherited.

Some acquired factors that may lead to increased red blood cell destruction or loss are:

blood loss, which can happen due to:
accidents or injuries
surgery
heavy menstrual bleeding
childbirth
endometriosis
gastrointestinal lesions, such as ulcers or those due to IBD or cancer
heavy nosebleeds
frequent blood donation
hemolysis, which is when red blood cells break down too soon due to things like:
autoimmune activity
certain infections
medication side effects
exposure to toxins
enlarged spleen
liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis
infections like malaria
Some inherited causes of increased red blood cell destruction can include:

sickle cell disease
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency
thalassemia
pyruvate kinase deficiency
hereditary spherocytosis
hereditary elliptocytosis",Anemia is linked to toxins and radiation therapy.,"Does not mention other causes like vitamin deficiencies, inherited disorders, or blood loss."
anemia,"Red blood cells are produced in your bone marrow and have an average lifespan of 100 to 120 days. On average, your bone marrow produces 2 million red blood cells each second while approximately the same number are removed from circulation.

About 1 percent of your red blood cells are removed from circulation and replaced each day.

Any process that has a negative effect on this balance between red blood cell production and destruction can cause anemia.

Causes of anemia are generally divided into those that decrease red blood cell production and those that increase red blood cell destruction or loss.

Factors that decrease red blood cell production
When red blood cell production is lower than normal, more red blood cells are leaving your body than entering circulation. This can potentially lead to anemia.

Factors that decrease red blood cells production can be divided into two categories – acquired and inherited.

Acquired factors that can decrease RBC production include:

inadequate dietary intake of nutrients important for red blood cells production, such as iron, vitamin B12, or folate
kidney disease
some types of cancer, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma
autoimmune diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis

polio,"Polio is caused by the poliovirus, which primarily targets nerve cells in the spinal cord and brainstem responsible for muscle movement. Nerve cells involved in sensation are generally unaffected.

The wild-type poliovirus, the naturally occurring strain, has been eliminated in most countries and now accounts for only a few cases of polio. However, the majority of infections worldwide are caused by the vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), a variant of the virus more prevalent in regions using an oral vaccine containing a weakened form of the poliovirus.

The weakened virus in the oral vaccine does not directly cause polio, and individuals vaccinated with it rarely contract VDPV. Instead, VDPV emerges in areas where vaccination rates are low, allowing the virus to circulate and evolve within the community.

While the weakened virus from the oral vaccine does not cause illness itself, it can spread within a population. In communities with high vaccination coverage, the spread is controlled. However, in areas with low vaccination rates, the virus can circulate for extended periods, increasing the likelihood of mutations that cause it to behave like the wild-type virus.

Cases of VDPV have been reported in the United States, primarily in individuals who were unvaccinated or had compromised immune systems. One notable case in New York in 2022 occurred in a county with below-average vaccination rates, and wastewater analysis confirmed the presence of VDPV in some communities.",Polio is caused by the poliovirus.,Omits the details about wild-type and vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) or the role of low vaccination rates.

The weakened virus in the oral vaccine does not directly cause polio, and individuals vaccinated with it rarely contract VDPV. Instead, VDPV emerges in areas where vaccination rates are low, allowing the virus to circulate and evolve within the community.

While the weakened virus from the oral vaccine does not cause illness itself, it can spread within a population. In communities with high vaccination coverage, the spread is controlled. However, in areas with low vaccination rates, the virus can circulate for extended periods, increasing the likelihood of mutations that cause it to behave like the wild-type virus.

hemophilia,"When a person bleeds, the body typically stops the bleeding by forming a clot. This process involves clotting factors, which are proteins in the blood, working together with platelets (specialized blood cells) to create the clot. Hemophilia occurs when a clotting factor is either missing or present at low levels.

Congenital Hemophilia
Hemophilia is most commonly inherited, meaning it is present from birth (congenital). Congenital hemophilia is categorized based on which clotting factor is deficient:

Hemophilia A: The most common type, caused by a deficiency of clotting factor 8.
Hemophilia B: The second most common type, caused by a deficiency of clotting factor 9.
Acquired Hemophilia
Some individuals develop hemophilia later in life, even without a family history of the disorder. This is known as acquired hemophilia.

Acquired hemophilia occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks clotting factor 8 or 9 in the blood. It is associated with conditions such as:

Pregnancy
Autoimmune diseases
Cancer
Multiple sclerosis
Drug reactions
Hemophilia Inheritance
In the most common forms of hemophilia, the faulty gene is located on the X chromosome. Every individual inherits two sex chromosomes, one from each parent. Females inherit one X chromosome from their mother and one X chromosome from their father, while males inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father.

Because the faulty gene is on the X chromosome, hemophilia primarily affects males and is typically passed from mother to son. Most women who carry the defective gene are asymptomatic carriers, although some may experience mild bleeding symptoms if their clotting factor levels are moderately reduced.",Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors.,Does not specify the types of hemophilia (A or B) or congenital vs. acquired forms.

Females inherit one X chromosome from their mother and one X chromosome from their father, while males inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father.

Because the faulty gene is on the X chromosome, hemophilia primarily affects males and is typically passed from mother to son. Most women who carry the defective gene are asymptomatic carriers, although some may experience mild bleeding symptoms if their clotting factor levels are moderately reduced.",Hemophilia occurs due to a genetic defect.,Does not include acquired hemophilia or the specific inheritance mechanism.
hemophilia,"When a person bleeds, the body typically stops the bleeding by forming a clot. This process involves clotting factors, which are proteins in the blood, working together with platelets (specialized blood cells) to create the clot. Hemophilia occurs when a clotting factor is either missing or present at low levels.

Congenital Hemophilia
Hemophilia is most commonly inherited, meaning it is present from birth (congenital). Congenital hemophilia is categorized based on which clotting factor is deficient:

Hemophilia A: The most common type, caused by a deficiency of clotting factor 8.
Hemophilia B: The second most common type, caused by a deficiency of clotting factor 9.
Acquired Hemophilia
Some individuals develop hemophilia later in life, even without a family history of the disorder. This is known as acquired hemophilia.

Acquired hemophilia occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks clotting factor 8 or 9 in the blood. It is associated with conditions such as:

Pregnancy
Autoimmune diseases

Most women who carry the defective gene are asymptomatic carriers, although some may experience mild bleeding symptoms if their clotting factor levels are moderately reduced.",Hemophilia occurs due to missing clotting proteins.,"Does not specify hemophilia A, B, or acquired forms and their causes."
hemophilia,"When a person bleeds, the body typically stops the bleeding by forming a clot. This process involves clotting factors, which are proteins in the blood, working together with platelets (specialized blood cells) to create the clot. Hemophilia occurs when a clotting factor is either missing or present at low levels.

Congenital Hemophilia
Hemophilia is most commonly inherited, meaning it is present from birth (congenital). Congenital hemophilia is categorized based on which clotting factor is deficient:

Hemophilia A: The most common type, caused by a deficiency of clotting factor 8.
Hemophilia B: The second most common type, caused by a deficiency of clotting factor 9.
Acquired Hemophilia
Some individuals develop hemophilia later in life, even without a family history of the disorder. This is known as acquired hemophilia.

Acquired hemophilia occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks clotting factor 8 or 9 in the blood. It is associated with conditions such as:

Pregnancy
Autoimmune diseases
Cancer
Multiple sclerosis
Drug reactions
Hemophilia Inheritance
In the most common forms of hemophilia, the faulty gene is located on the X chromosome. Every individual inherits two sex chromosomes, one from each parent. Females inherit one X chromosome from their mother and one X chromosome from their father, while males inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father.

It’s also possible that some people are genetically predisposed to develop CFS.

Though CFS can sometimes develop after a viral infection, no single type of infection has been found to cause CFS. Some viral infections that have been studied in relation to CFS include those caused by:

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
human herpesvirus 6
Ross River virus (RRV)
rubella virus
Infections caused by bacteria, including Coxiella burnetii and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, have also been studied in relation to CFS.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has suggested that CFS may be the end stage of multiple different conditions, rather than one specific condition.

In fact, about 1 in 10 people with EBV, Ross River virus, or Coxiella burnetii infection will develop a condition that meets the criteria for a CFS diagnosis.

Additionally, researchers say that those who’ve had severe symptoms with any of these three infections are at a higher risk for later developing CFS.

People with CFS sometimes have weakened immune systems, but doctors don’t know whether this is enough to cause the disorder.

People with CFS can also sometimes have abnormal hormone levels. Doctors haven’t yet concluded whether this is significant, either.

People with CFS sometimes have weakened immune systems, but doctors don’t know whether this is enough to cause the disorder.

People with CFS can also sometimes have abnormal hormone levels. Doctors haven’t yet concluded whether this is significant, either.
