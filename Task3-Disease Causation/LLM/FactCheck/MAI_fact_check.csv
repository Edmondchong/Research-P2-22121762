0,"Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the body cannot properly produce or use insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. There are several main causes of diabetes:

1. Genetics and family history: If you have a parent, brother, or sister with diabetes, you are more likely to develop the disease. Certain genes have been linked to an increased risk of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

2. Excess body weight and obesity: Being overweight or obese is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Extra body fat can make it harder for the body to use insulin effectively, leading to high blood sugar levels.

3. Physical inactivity: Lack of physical activity can contribute to weight gain and make it harder for the body to use insulin effectively. This can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

4. Poor diet: Eating a diet that is high in processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Eating a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help reduce the risk.

5. Age: The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age. People over the age of 45 are at higher risk, but type 2 diabetes can occur at any age, even in children and adolescents.

Uric acid is a waste product that is formed when the body breaks down purines, which are substances found in certain foods, such as red meat, organ meats, and seafood, as well as in certain beverages, such as alcohol, especially beer.

Here are the main causes of gout:

1. Diet: Consuming a diet high in purines can increase the risk of gout. Foods high in purines include red meat, organ meats (such as liver and kidney), seafood (such as shellfish, anchovies, and sardines), and alcohol, especially beer.
2. Genetics: Gout tends to run in families, and certain genetic factors can increase the risk of developing gout.
3. Medical conditions: Certain medical conditions can increase the risk of gout, including high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease, and certain metabolic disorders.

1. Plasmodium Parasites: There are five parasite species that cause malaria in humans, and two of these species - Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax - pose the greatest threat.

2. Anopheles Mosquitoes: These are the mosquitoes that transmit malaria parasites. They acquire the parasites when they feed on infected people.

3. Bite of an Infected Mosquito: When a mosquito bites an infected person, it ingests parasites in the blood. These parasites develop and multiply in the mosquito's body. When the mosquito then bites another person, it injects the parasites into that person's blood.

4. Lack of Protection: People who live in areas where malaria is common and who do not have access to protective measures, such as insecticide-treated bed nets, are at greatest risk of contracting the disease.

5. Travel to Malaria-Endemic Areas: People who travel to areas where malaria is common and do not take protective measures are also at risk.

There are a number of factors that can trigger migraines, including:

1. Emotional triggers: Stress, anxiety, tension, excitement, depression, shock or fear.
2. Physical triggers: Tiredness, insufficient sleep, poor posture, neck or shoulder tension, physical overexertion, jet lag.
3. Dietary triggers: Missed, delayed or irregular meals, dehydration, alcohol, particularly red wine, the artificial sweetener aspartame, caffeine, chocolate, citrus fruits, cheese, monosodium glutamate (MSG), found in many processed foods.
4. Environmental triggers: Bright lights, flickering screens, loud noises, strong smells, smoke, changes in weather or environment, e.g. going to higher altitudes or into different temperature zones.
5. Medication triggers: Some types of medication can trigger migraines, including oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy (HRT).
6. Hormonal triggers: Fluctuations in hormones during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and menopause can also trigger migraines.

1. Fecal matter (stool)
2. Foreign body
3. Inflammatory bowel disease
4. Tumors

This blockage can lead to increased pressure, inflammation, and infection inside the appendix, which can cause its wall to rupture. A ruptured appendix can lead to peritonitis, a serious inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity.

It's important to note that appendicitis can occur at any age, but it's more common in people between the ages of 10 and 30.",0.7776018381118774,0.8546059131622314,0.7939534187316895,,,Appendicitis,"1, 3, 4, 2, appendicitis, between the ages of 10 and 30","4, between the ages of 10 and 30, 1, 3, 2","4, between the ages of 10 and 30, 1, 3, 2, appendicitis"
7,"Diarrhea can be caused by a variety of factors. Here are some of the most common causes:

1. Infections: Bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections are the most common causes of diarrhea. These infections can be contracted through contaminated food or water, or by coming into contact with someone who is already infected.

2. Food intolerances or allergies: Some people may experience diarrhea after consuming foods that their body cannot tolerate or is allergic to. This can include lactose intolerance, gluten intolerance, or other food sensitivities.

3. Medications: Certain medications, such as antibiotics, can cause diarrhea as a side effect. This occurs because antibiotics can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the gut, leading to loose stools.

4. Digestive disorders: Chronic digestive disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or celiac disease, can cause diarrhea.

5. Surgery: Some surgical procedures, particularly those that involve the gut, can lead to diarrhea.

8,"The exact cause of endometriosis is still not fully understood by medical professionals. However, several theories have been proposed regarding its development. Here are the most accepted potential causes:

1. Retrograde menstruation: This is the most widely accepted theory. It suggests that endometrial tissue, which normally lines the inside of the uterus, flows back through the fallopian tubes into the pelvic cavity during menstruation. This displaced tissue can then implant and grow on other pelvic organs, leading to endometriosis.
2. Embryonic cell transformation: Another theory suggests that during embryonic development, cells in the pelvic cavity may transform into endometrial-like cells under certain conditions. These cells can then proliferate and cause endometriosis.
3. Coelomic metaplasia: This theory proposes that certain cells in the peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity) can transform into endometrial cells due to exposure to specific hormones or inflammatory factors.
4. Lymphatic or vascular spread: Endometrial cells may spread to other parts of the body through the lymphatic system or blood vessels. However, this theory does not fully explain why endometrial tissue primarily affects the pelvic cavity.

1. Genetic factors: Some types of epilepsy are linked to specific genes and can be passed down through families. However, it's important to note that inheriting a genetic predisposition does not guarantee that a person will develop epilepsy.

2. Brain injury or trauma: Head injuries, strokes, brain tumors, and other conditions that cause damage to the brain can lead to epilepsy.

3. Infectious diseases: Some infections, such as meningitis, encephalitis, and AIDS, can affect the brain and cause epilepsy.

4. Prenatal injuries and infections: Conditions that damage the brain before birth, such as fetal alcohol syndrome, maternal infections, or a lack of oxygen during delivery, can lead to epilepsy.

5. Developmental disorders: Certain developmental disorders, such as autism and neurofibromatosis, are associated with an increased risk of epilepsy.

1. Infections: Bacterial and viral infections are the most common causes of fever. These include pneumonia, ear infections, urinary tract infections, meningitis, and the flu.

2. Inflammatory conditions: Certain inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease can cause a fever.

3. Immunizations: Some vaccinations can cause a fever as a side effect.

4. Certain medications: Some drugs, like antibiotics and chemotherapy, can cause a fever.

5. Illnesses in other parts of the body: A fever can be a sign of a problem elsewhere in the body, such as a heart attack or a blood clot.

6. Heat exhaustion or sunstroke: Overexposure to heat can cause a fever.

7. Other causes: Less common causes of fever include cancer, hormonal disorders, and autoimmune diseases.

11,"The exact cause of fibromyalgia is not fully understood, but it is believed to be due to a combination of factors rather than a single cause. These factors can be broadly categorized into the following:

1. Physical trauma or injury: Fibromyalgia can sometimes occur after a physical trauma, such as a car accident, or after a viral infection. This is often referred to as post-traumatic fibromyalgia.

2. Genetic factors: Research suggests that there might be a genetic component to fibromyalgia. It seems to run in some families, and certain genetic markers have been identified in people with the condition. However, it's unclear how genes might influence the development of fibromyalgia.

3. Neurochemical abnormalities: People with fibromyalgia seem to have lower levels of certain brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) that transmit pain signals. This may cause an increased sensitivity to pain, making the brain interpret even minor sensations as painful.

4. Central nervous system dysfunction: Fibromyalgia is thought to be a disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). In people with fibromyalgia, the CNS appears to process pain signals differently, amplifying them and creating a heightened sensitivity to pain. This is sometimes referred to as Central Sensitization.

12,"The primary causes of gallstones include:

1. High cholesterol levels: When the liver produces more cholesterol than the bile can dissolve, the excess cholesterol can form into crystals and eventually become gallstones.

2. High bilirubin levels: Bilirubin is a waste product produced by the liver. Certain conditions can cause the liver to produce too much bilirubin, which can lead to the formation of gallstones.

3. Inadequate bile salts: Bile salts help to break down cholesterol in bile, preventing it from crystallizing. If the body does not produce enough bile salts, gallstones can form.

4. Bile stasis or stagnant bile: If bile stays in the gallbladder for a long time, it can become very concentrated, which can lead to the formation of gallstones.

5. Genetic factors: Some people have a genetic predisposition to develop gallstones.

6. Obesity: Obesity increases the risk of gallstone formation because it increases the amount of cholesterol in bile and slows down gallbladder emptying.

7. Rapid weight loss: Rapid weight loss can cause the liver to release more cholesterol into the bile, increasing the risk",0.873365581035614,0.8815024495124817,0.7430062890052795,,Approximately 4,"two, CT","1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2, 7","6, 4, 1, 3, 2, 7","6, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5, 7"
13,"GERD, or gastroesophageal reflux disease, is a condition in which stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, causing symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, and difficulty swallowing. The main causes of GERD are:

1. A weak lower esophageal sphincter (LES): The LES is a circular band of muscle at the bottom of the esophagus that acts as a valve, allowing food and liquid to pass into the stomach and preventing stomach acid from flowing back into the esophagus. If the LES is weak or relaxes inappropriately, stomach acid can leak back into the esophagus, causing GERD.
2. Obesity: Being overweight or obese increases the pressure on the abdomen, which can push the stomach acid up into the esophagus.
3. Hiatal hernia: A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of the stomach bulges through the diaphragm and into the chest cavity. This can cause the LES to relax, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus.
4. Pregnancy: Hormonal changes and the increased pressure on the abdomen during pregnancy can lead to GERD symptoms.

14,"Heart attacks, also known as myocardial infarctions, are typically caused by a combination of factors that contribute to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is the underlying condition that leads to most heart attacks, and it involves the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle.

The main causes of heart attacks include:

1. Atherosclerosis: This is the process of plaque buildup in the arteries, which can narrow or block them, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances found in the blood.
2. High blood pressure: Chronic high blood pressure can damage the arteries and make them more susceptible to plaque buildup.
3. High cholesterol: High levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood can increase the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries.
4. Smoking: Smoking damages the arteries and makes them more prone to plaque buildup. It also increases heart rate and blood pressure, which can strain the heart.
5. Diabetes: People with diabetes have a higher risk of heart attacks because high blood sugar levels can damage the arteries and increase the risk of plaque buildup.

1. Straining during bowel movements: This is the most common cause of hemorrhoids. When you strain during a bowel movement, it puts pressure on the veins in the rectum and anus, causing them to bulge and swell.
2. Chronic constipation or diarrhea: Both constipation and diarrhea can cause you to strain during bowel movements, leading to hemorrhoids.
3. Sitting for long periods of time: Sitting for long periods of time, especially on the toilet, can put pressure on the veins in the rectum and anus, leading to hemorrhoids.
4. Obesity: Obesity can put extra pressure on the veins in the rectum and anus, leading to hemorrhoids.
5. Pregnancy: Pregnancy can cause hemorrhoids due to the increased pressure on the veins in the pelvic area.

19,"A hernia occurs when an organ or fatty tissue squeezes through a weak spot in a surrounding muscle or connective tissue called fascia. The main causes of hernia include:

1. Increased pressure within the abdomen: This can be due to heavy lifting, straining during bowel movements or urination, obesity, or fluid accumulation in the abdomen.

2. Weakness in the abdominal wall: Some people are born with weak abdominal walls, which can lead to a hernia. This can also occur as a result of aging, injury, or surgery in the abdominal area.

3. Congenital defects: Some people are born with a defect in the abdominal wall that can lead to a hernia later in life.

4. Chronic coughing or sneezing: Persistent coughing or sneezing can put increased pressure on the abdominal wall and lead to a hernia.

5. Poor nutrition and lifestyle choices: A diet lacking in essential nutrients, smoking, and alcohol abuse can all weaken the abdominal wall and make a hernia more likely.

39,"Pancreatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the pancreas, a gland located behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes and insulin. There are two main types of pancreatitis: acute and chronic.

The main causes of acute pancreatitis include:

1. Gallstones: Gallstones are the most common cause of acute pancreatitis. They can block the pancreatic duct, causing inflammation.
2. Alcohol abuse: Excessive alcohol consumption is a common cause of acute pancreatitis. It can damage the pancreas and cause inflammation.
3. High levels of triglycerides in the blood: High levels of triglycerides, a type of fat found in the blood, can cause inflammation of the pancreas.
4. Certain medications: Some medications, such as corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can increase the risk of developing pancreatitis.
5. Trauma or injury to the abdomen: Trauma or injury to the abdomen can cause pancreatitis.
6. Infections: Certain viral infections, such as mumps, can cause pancreatitis.

40,"Tuberculosis (TB) is primarily caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here are the main ways people get infected:

1. Inhalation of infectious droplets: TB is typically spread from person to person through the air. When someone with the active form of TB in their lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, or talks, they release tiny droplets containing the bacteria. If you breathe in these droplets, you may become infected.

2. Prolonged exposure: You're more likely to get TB if you spend a lot of time around someone who has the active form of the disease. This is especially true if that person isn't getting treated or if the treatment isn't working.

3. Weakened immune system: People with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to TB. This includes people living with HIV/AIDS, those receiving treatment for cancer, people with diabetes, and those taking medications that suppress the immune system.

4. Malnutrition and poverty: Poor living conditions, overcrowding, and poor nutrition can increase the risk of TB infection.

5. Travel or migration: Traveling to or living in a country with a high rate of TB can increase your risk of infection.

6. Occupational exposure: Healthcare workers, prison staff, and people who",0.7751821875572205,0.7954306602478027,0.8636354804039001,2 to 3 weeks,About a quarter,"the last 2 years, AUD","6, 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, Healthcare","6, 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, Healthcare","6, 4, 1, 3, 5, Mycobacterium, 2, Healthcare"
41,"Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which is part of the herpes virus family. It is highly contagious and spreads easily from person to person through direct contact with the virus, such as when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also be spread through contact with the fluid from chickenpox blisters.

A person with chickenpox is most contagious from 1 to 2 days before the rash appears and until all the blisters have formed scabs, which usually takes about 5 to 7 days after the rash first appears.

Chickenpox is most common in children, but it can occur in people of any age who have not had the disease or been vaccinated. Once a person recovers from chickenpox, the virus remains in the body and can reactivate later in life, causing shingles.",0.9015993475914001,0.8173320293426514,0.8849552869796753,"the age of 10, under 1 year old","one to two days, VZV","1 year old, under 1 year old, age 10",about 5 to 7 days,"first, 1 to 2 days, about 5 to 7 days","first, about 5 to 7 days"
42,"Mumps is caused by the mumps virus, which is a member of the paramyxovirus family. It is typically spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also be spread through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets from an infected person, such as by sharing utensils or cups, or by kissing.

Mumps is most contagious a few days before and after the symptoms appear. It can be spread by people who do not have any symptoms, but they are less likely to spread the virus than those who are actively sick.

Mumps is preventable with a vaccine. The mumps vaccine is usually given to children as part of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is typically given in two doses, the first at 12-15 months of age and the second at 4-6 years of age.

In addition to vaccination, good hygiene practices, such as covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and regularly washing hands, can help reduce the spread of mumps and other respiratory illnesses.",0.7860714197158813,0.8365252017974854,0.8265149593353271,"the United States, summer","2 to 12, 12 to 25 days","about 12 to 25 days, ages 2 through 12","4-6 years of age, 12-15 months of age and the, MMR, first, two, second, a few days","4-6 years of age, 12-15 months of age and the, MMR, first, two, second, a few days","4-6 years of age, 12-15 months of age and the, MMR, first, two, second, a few days"
43,"Tetanus is caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which is found in soil, dust, and manure. The bacteria produce a toxin called tetanospasmin, which affects the nervous system and can lead to muscle spasms, stiffness, and lockjaw.

The main causes of tetanus include:

1. Wound infections: Tetanus bacteria can enter the body through a wound or cut, especially if the wound is deep or dirty.
2. Lack of vaccination: Tetanus is preventable through vaccination, and those who have not been vaccinated or haven't had a booster shot in the past 10 years are at higher risk of developing tetanus.
3. Umbilical cord infection: Newborns can get tetanus if the umbilical cord stump is contaminated with tetanus-contaminated soil or instruments during or after delivery.
4. Injecting drugs: People who inject drugs are at higher risk of tetanus if they use contaminated needles or inject drugs into dirty skin.
5. Foreign bodies: Tetanus can also occur when foreign bodies, such as splinters, fracture fragments, or metal filings, become embedded in the skin and provide a site for the bacteria to grow.",0.7103680372238159,0.8089227676391602,0.6801258325576782,,Bacteria,"more than 40 years, first, the United States","Newborns, 4, Tetanus, 1, 3, 2, 5, the past 10 years","Newborns, 4, Tetanus, 1, 3, 2, 5, the past 10 years","Newborns, 4, Tetanus, 1, 3, 2, 5, Clostridium, the past 10 years"
44,"Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a highly infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. The virus spreads from person to person, primarily through the fecal-oral route. This means it can be spread if an infected person doesn't wash their hands properly after defecating and then touches food or water that others consume.

The main causes of polio can be summarized as follows:

1. Infection with the poliovirus: Polio is caused by one of three serotypes of the poliovirus. Infection typically occurs through ingestion of contaminated food or water.

2. Poor sanitation and hygiene: Lack of access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities increases the risk of poliovirus transmission. This is particularly true in areas with poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands after using the toilet.

3. Inadequate immunization: Polio can be prevented through vaccination. Inadequate immunization, either due to lack of access to the vaccine or refusal to vaccinate, leaves individuals and communities vulnerable to poliovirus infection.

4. Population movements: Migration, travel, and displacement can contribute to the spread of poliovirus, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage.

45,"The exact cause of lupus is not known, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors. 

1. Genetic Factors: Certain genes are associated with an increased risk of developing lupus. However, having these genes does not guarantee that a person will develop the disease. It is thought that multiple genes, in combination with other factors, are necessary to trigger lupus.

2. Environmental Factors: Exposure to sunlight, certain drugs, infections, and stress can trigger lupus or cause a flare-up of symptoms in people who already have the disease. 

3. Hormonal Factors: Lupus is more common in women than men, which suggests that hormones may play a role in the development of the disease. However, the exact relationship between hormones and lupus is not fully understood.

4. Immune System Dysfunction: Lupus is an autoimmune disease, which means that the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In people with lupus, the immune system produces an overabundance of certain types of antibodies, which can cause inflammation and damage to various parts of the body.

5. Epigenetic Factors: Epigenetic changes refer to modifications in gene expression that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence.

46,"Hemophilia is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the genes that produce clotting factors, which are proteins needed for normal blood clotting. 

There are two main types of hemophilia: A and B. In both types, the lack of adequate clotting factor leads to excessive bleeding after injuries or surgery, and sometimes for no reason at all.

Hemophilia A is caused by mutations in the F8 gene, which provides instructions for making clotting factor VIII. Hemophilia B is caused by mutations in the F9 gene, which provides instructions for making clotting factor IX.

Hemophilia is usually inherited, which means it's passed down from parents to their children through their genes. If a parent has the disease or is a carrier, there is a 50% chance that each of their children will inherit the mutated gene.

In about 30% of cases, hemophilia results from a new mutation in the clotting factor gene and occurs in people with no family history of the disorder. In these cases, the mutation is not inherited from a parent.",0.8167580962181091,0.8471421599388123,0.7876996994018555,"8, Autoimmune, one, Cancer

47,"The exact cause of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) remains unknown, and it's likely that a combination of factors can contribute to the development of this condition. Several theories have been proposed, but none have been definitively proven. Here are some of the main theories:

1. Viral Infections: Some research suggests that CFS may be triggered by viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 6, or Ross River virus. However, no single virus has been consistently linked to CFS.

2. Immune System Dysfunction: People with CFS often have changes in their immune system, but it's unclear whether these changes are a cause or effect of the condition. Some researchers believe that an immune system dysfunction could make people more susceptible to developing CFS.

3. Hormonal Imbalances: People with CFS sometimes have hormonal imbalances, particularly involving cortisol, a stress hormone, and other hormones produced in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, or adrenal glands. However, it's not clear whether these imbalances are a cause or effect of CFS.

4. Physical or Emotional Trauma: Some people develop CFS after a significant physical or emotional trauma, such as a car accident or the death of a loved one.",0.749782919883728,0.5564271211624146,0.8351982831954956,Infections,"CDC, Mycoplasma, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, three, RRV, 10, B12, Coxiella, about 1, EBV, Infections","many years, two","Ross River, Immune System Dysfunction, 6, 4, 1, CFS, 3, Epstein-Barr, 2, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome","Immune System Dysfunction, 4, 1, 3, 2, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome","Ross River, Immune System Dysfunction, 6, 4, 1, 3, 2, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome"
