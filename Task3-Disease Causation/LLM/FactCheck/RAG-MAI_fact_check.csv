0,"Based on the information provided by trusted sources (MayoClinic, MedlinePlus, and Healthline), the main causes of diabetes include:

1. **Genetic factors**: Genes may play a role in several types of diabetes, including type 1, type 2, and type 1.5. Family members can share genes that increase the risk of developing diabetes.
2. **Environmental factors**: Researchers think that certain environmental factors can trigger the development of diabetes. For type 1 diabetes, it may be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
3. **Lifestyle factors**: Having a lifestyle that contributes to excess weight, obesity, and physical inactivity (e.g., type 2 diabetes) increases your risk of developing diabetes.
4. **Imbalanced hormones**: Hormonal changes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) can cause a decrease in insulin sensitivity and lead to high blood sugar levels.
5. **Autoimmune conditions**: In autoimmune conditions like type 1 and type 1.5, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

It's worth noting that the exact cause of most types of diabetes is still unknown, and the current understanding of diabetes etiology is likely to evolve as new research emerges.",0.7281122803688049,0.8827382326126099,0.8594887256622314,"two, Glucose, Insulin, Sugar",Gestational,,"3, MedlinePlus, 1.5, 4, MayoClinic, 5, Healthline","3, MedlinePlus, 4, MayoClinic, 5, Healthline","3, MedlinePlus, 1.5, 4, MayoClinic, 5, Healthline"

8,"Based on the provided information from MayoClinic and MedlinePlus, the main causes of endometriosis are not definitively known, but the following are some possible contributing factors:

1. **Retrograde menstruation**: When menstrual blood flows back through the fallopian tubes and into the pelvic cavity instead of out of the body, it may carry endometrial cells that attach and grow, leading to endometriosis.

2. **Transformed peritoneal cells**: Hormones or immune factors might transform cells that line the inner side of the abdomen into cells that are similar to those that line the inside of the uterus.

3. **Embryonic cell changes**: Hormones such as estrogen may transform embryonic cells into endometrial-like cell growths during puberty.

4. **Surgical scar complication**: Endometrial cells may attach to scar tissue from a cut made during surgery, such as a C-section.

5. **Endometrial cell transport**: The blood vessels or tissue fluid system may move endometrial cells to other parts of the body.

6. **Immune system condition**: A problem with the immune system may make the body unable to recognize and destroy endometriosis tissue.

Other factors that may contribute to the development of endometriosis include:

7. **Genetics**: Some research suggests that endometriosis may run in families.

2. Lack of substances that prevent crystal formation: The urine may lack substances that prevent crystals from sticking together, creating an ideal environment for kidney stones to form.
3. Genetic factors: Certain genetic changes can increase the risk of developing kidney stones by altering the levels of minerals and compounds in cells, leading to an imbalance in urine.
4. Environmental and lifestyle factors:
   - Dehydration (too little water in the body)
   - Diet:
     - High oxalate content from foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and chocolate
     - High protein, salt, or glucose diet
     - Calcium-deficient diet
   - Medications:
     - Diuretics, which increase urine production and lead to dehydration
     - Calcium antacids, which neutralize stomach acids and can increase the risk of developing stones
5. Underlying health conditions:
   - Hypercalciuria (high levels of calcium in the urine)
   - Obesity
   - Type 2 diabetes

24,"Based on the trusted information provided, the main causes of osteoarthritis can be summarized as follows:

1. Gradual joint and cartilage damage: The main cause of osteoarthritis is the gradual deterioration of the cartilage that cushions the ends of bones in the joints, leading to bones rubbing against each other.

2. Genetic factors: Genetic variations affect the amount, timing, and location of gene activity, especially genes involved in the formation and maintenance of bone and cartilage. These genetic changes can combine to increase the risk of developing the disorder, even with small effects.

3. Environmental and lifestyle factors:
   - Obesity
   - Injuries such as torn cartilage, dislocated joints, or ligament injuries
   - Age 50 years and older
   - Sex (being assigned female at birth)
   - Occupations that involve repetitive joint stress (kneeling, climbing, heavy lifting, etc.)
   - Presence of another medical condition that affects joint health

4. The imbalance between buildup and breakdown of cartilage: In osteoarthritis, the balance between the buildup and breakdown of cartilage is lost, leading to cartilage damage and overall breakdown.

5. Body's failed attempts to repair damage: The condition is thought to be the result of the body's failed attempts to repair joint damage, which can trigger an immune response, causing inflammation of other joint tissues and leading to further joint damage.

These causes allow the virus to spread from person to person.",0.8972235918045044,0.8282908797264099,0.8782061338424683,the United States,"12 to 25 days, 2 to 12","about 12 to 25 days, ages 2 through 12","2, 3, three, 4, 1","2, 3, three, 4, 1, summer","2, 3, three, 4, 1, summer"
43,"According to the information from MayoClinic, MedlinePlus, and Healthline, the main causes of tetanus infection are:

1. Entrapping spores of Clostridium tetani in a wound or cut.
2. Exposing the skin to contaminated soil, dirt, animal feces, or saliva.
3. Other injuries, including:
   - Crush injuries
   - Injuries with dead tissue
   - Burns
   - Puncture wounds from piercings, tattoos, injection drug use, or injury (such as stepping on a nail)

In particular, MedlinePlus states that nearly all cases of tetanus in the United States occur in individuals who have not been vaccinated against the disease, suggesting an injury or exposure primarily as the cause of infection.",0.6760443449020386,0.8128734827041626,0.6817977428436279,,Bacteria,"more than 40 years, first","2, the United States, MedlinePlus, 3, 1, MayoClinic, Healthline","2, the United States, 3, MedlinePlus, 1, MayoClinic, Healthline","2, 3, MedlinePlus, Clostridium, 1, MayoClinic, Healthline"
44,"According to the information provided by MayoClinic, MedlinePlus, and Healthline, the main causes of polio are:

1. Infection with the poliovirus: Polio is caused by the poliovirus, which primarily targets nerve cells in the spinal cord and brainstem responsible for muscle movement, nerve cells involved in sensation are generally unaffected.

2. Exposure to the weakened poliovirus in an oral vaccine: The weakened virus in the oral vaccine can spread through a community, especially in areas with low vaccination rates, allowing the virus to circulate and evolve.

3. Direct contact with an infected person or object (e.g., infected mucus, phlegm, or feces): The virus can spread through direct person-to-person contact, contact with infected respiratory and gastrointestinal secretions, or contact with contaminated material.

Additionally, cases of polio have been linked to:

- Lack of immunization against polio
- Travel to areas with polio outbreaks
- Having a significantly weakened immune system",0.8303840160369873,0.7975336313247681,0.774767279624939,"New York, the United States, 2000, One, 2022, VDPV, Infections","New York, the United States, One, 2022, VDPV","7 to 14 days, Pakistan, the past 25 years, Afghanistan, 5 to 35 days","2, 3, MedlinePlus, 1, MayoClinic, Healthline","2, 3, MedlinePlus, 1, MayoClinic, Healthline","2, 3, MedlinePlus, 1, MayoClinic, Healthline"
45,"Based on the trusted information from the sources provided:

1. Genetics: Lupus has a genetic component, with over 50 genes associated with the condition. Having a family history of lupus may also increase a person's risk.

2. Environmental factors: These include:
   - Exposure to sunlight (potential trigger, but cause remains unknown)
   - Viral infections
   - Exposure to toxins like silica dust
   - Smoking
   - Stress

3. Hormones: Atypical hormone levels, such as increased estrogen levels, have been suggested as a potential contributor to lupus.

4. Infections: The exact link between lupus and infections is still being studied, but potential triggers may include cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr infections.

5. Medications: Some medications can triggers lupus, including:
   - Certain blood pressure medications
   - Anti-seizure medications
   - Antibiotics
   - Hydralazine (Apresoline)
   - Procainamide (Procanbid)
   - Quinidine
   - TNF blocker medications
   - Tetracyclines (e.g., minocycline)

46,"The main causes of hemophilia are:

1. **Inherited gene variants**: The most common cause of hemophilia, typically inherited through the X chromosome in males and passed from mother to son. The inherited type is usually categorized into two main subtypes:
   - **Hemophilia A**: Caused by a deficiency of clotting factor 8.
   - **Hemophilia B**: Caused by a deficiency of clotting factor 9.

2. **Acquired hemophilia**: Also known as non-inherited hemophilia, this form of the disorder is caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking clotting factor 8 or 9 in the blood. This type is not passed from parents to offspring but can occur in individuals who:
   - Have conditions such as pregnancy, autoimmune diseases, cancer, multiple sclerosis, or drug reactions.
   - Are classified as ""autoantibodies"" (abnormal antibodies produced by the body) that react against clotting factors, leading to their malfunction.",0.7823269367218018,0.8459786176681519,0.6978973150253296,"Cancer

47,"The main causes of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) are not fully understood, but some factors are believed to be involved. These factors can be categorized into the following groups:

1. Genetic predisposition: Research suggests that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the development of CFS.
2. Infections: Certain viral and bacterial infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Ross River virus (RRV), rubella virus, Coxiella burnetii and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, have been linked to CFS.
   - About 1 in 10 people with these infections will develop a condition that meets the criteria for a CFS diagnosis.
   - Those who've had severe symptoms with these infections are at a higher risk for later developing CFS.

3. Immune system problems: Some people with CFS may have weakened immune systems, but it is unclear if this is enough to cause the disorder.
4. Hormonal imbalances: Abnormal hormone levels have been found in some people with CFS, but it is unsure if this is significant.
5. Physical or emotional trauma: Some people report experiencing an injury, surgery, or significant emotional stress shortly before their symptoms began.
   - Problems with energy usage may also play a role, as some people with ME/CFS have difficulty converting the body's fuel into energy.
6. Stress: Chronic stress is also considered a contributing factor to CFS.
