24,"The main causes of osteoarthritis are complex and multi-factorial. While the exact underlying cause is still not fully understood, based on the information provided:

1. **Genetics**: Multiple genetic variations, which subtly change gene activity (expression), contribute to the risk of developing osteoarthritis. These genetic changes affect the formation and maintenance of bone and cartilage.
2. **Gradual joint and cartilage damage**: Cartilage breakdown over time, leading to bones rubbing against each other, is a key characteristic of osteoarthritis.
3. **Interplay between genetics and environmental/lifestyle factors**: Genetic predispositions can be amplified by environmental and lifestyle factors, such as obesity, excessive joint stress, past injuries, age, and certain occupations.
4. **Failed attempts to repair joint damage**: The body's attempts to repair joint damage lead to changes in bone and connective tissue, causing further joint damage and inflammation.

Key risk factors that contribute to osteoarthritis development and progression include:

- Genetics (family history)
- Past injuries
- Age (50+ years)
- Being assigned female at birth
- Obesity/overweight

38,"The main causes of anemia can be broadly classified into several categories:

**Decreased Red Blood Cell Production**

1. **Iron deficiency anemia**: caused by inadequate dietary intake of iron, blood loss, or lack of iron supplementation during pregnancy.
2. **Vitamin deficiency anemia**: caused by inadequate folate or vitamin B-12 in the diet, or difficulty absorbing vitamin B-12.
3. **Anemia of inflammation**: caused by chronic diseases such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, or Crohn's disease.
4. **Aplastic anemia**: a rare, life-threatening condition where the body stops making enough new blood cells.
5. **Anemias related to bone marrow diseases**: disorders such as leukemia or myelofibrosis can disrupt red blood cell production.

**Increased Red Blood Cell Destruction or Loss**

1. **Hemolytic anemias**: caused by red blood cells being destroyed faster than the bone marrow can replace them, often due to inherited conditions such as:
	* Sickle cell disease
	* Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency
	* Thalassemia
	* Pyruvate kinase deficiency
	* Hereditary spherocytosis
	* Hereditary elliptocytosis

40,"According to the provided information, the main causes of tuberculosis (TB) are:

1. **Inhaling Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria**: TB is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is spread through the air when someone with active TB disease coughs, sneezes, talks, or sings, releasing tiny droplets that carry the bacteria.

2. **Poor treatment and misuse of antibiotics**: Drug-resistant strains of TB can develop when antibiotic drugs are not used correctly or fail to kill all the bacteria, leading to the establishment and multiplication of resistant bacteria.

3. **Underlying health conditions**: Certain people are more likely to develop TB disease after being infected, including those with weakened immune systems (such as people with HIV), young children, older adults, people with other diseases like diabetes, and those who have not been treated correctly for TB in the past.

4. **Living or working in crowded spaces**: The disease spreads more easily in crowded gatherings and in places where people live or work together for long periods, especially in countries or areas where TB is common.

These factors contribute to the spread of TB and the development of the disease in susceptible individuals.",0.8170756697654724,0.7861132025718689,0.7909238934516907,2 to 3 weeks,About a quarter,"AUD, the last 2 years","2, 4, 1, 3","2, 4, 1, 3","2, 3, 4, 1, Mycobacterium"

1. **Injuries with exposure to contaminated soil, dirt, or dust**, where the Clostridium tetani spores can enter the body through wounds.
2. **Animal droppings or feces**, which can lead to tetanus exposure through wounds or skin contact.
3. **Wounds contaminated with dead tissue**, as the bacteria can thrive in anaerobic conditions (without oxygen).
4. **Crush injuries**, which can create an environment that allows the bacteria to grow.
5. **Puncture wounds** from various sources, such as:
   - Piercings
   - Tattoos
   - Injection drug use
   - Injury from stepping on a nail
6. **Infections in wounds that are deep or have poor blood circulation**, allowing the bacteria to grow and spread.

44,"According to the provided information from MayoClinic, MedlinePlus, and Healthline, the main causes of polio are:

1. **Infection with the poliovirus**: The poliovirus is the direct cause of polio, and it targets nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain stem responsible for muscle movement.

2. **Wild-type poliovirus (WPV)**: Although the naturally occurring wild-type poliovirus has been eliminated in most countries, it still causes a few cases of polio.

3. **Vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV)**: VDPV, a variant of the virus, is responsible for the majority of polio infections worldwide, especially in areas with low vaccination rates where the virus can circulate and evolve.

4. **Low vaccination rates**: In areas with low vaccination rates, the weakened virus from the oral vaccine can spread and increase the likelihood of mutations that cause it to behave like the wild-type virus.

5. **Compromised immune system**: Individuals with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to contracting polio from VDPV, even if they have been vaccinated.

6. **Direct person-to-person contact**: The poliovirus can spread through contact with infected mucus or phlegm from the nose or mouth, contact with infected feces, or through direct person-to-person contact.

7. **Travel to an area with a polio outbreak**: Traveling to areas with a polio outbreak increases the risk",0.8827979564666748,0.8533287644386292,0.6862739324569702,"New York, the United States, 2000, One, 2022, Infections","New York, the United States, One, 2022","7 to 14 days, Pakistan, the past 25 years, Afghanistan, 5 to 35 days","2, 3, MedlinePlus, 6, 4, 1, MayoClinic, 7, 5, Healthline","2, 3, MedlinePlus, 6, 4, 1, MayoClinic, 7, 5, Healthline","2, 3, MedlinePlus, 6, 4, 1, MayoClinic, 7, 5, VDPV, Healthline"

46,"The main causes of hemophilia include:

1. **Genetic inheritance**: Hemophilia is usually inherited from a parent, with the faulty gene located on the X chromosome. It is primarily passed from mother to son.
2. **Mutations in the F8 or F9 gene**: Variants in the F8 gene cause hemophilia A, while variants in the F9 gene cause hemophilia B. These genetic mutations affect the production of coagulation factor VIII (F8) or coagulation factor IX (F9).
3. **Acquired causes**: Acquired hemophilia occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks clotting factor 8 or 9 in the blood, often associated with:
	* Pregnancy
	* Autoimmune diseases
	* Cancer
	* Multiple sclerosis
	* Drug reactions

It's worth noting that the causes of hemophilia can be categorized into two main types:

* **Congenital hemophilia**: Inherited from a parent and present from birth.
* **Acquired hemophilia**: Develops later in life, often associated with underlying medical conditions or autoimmune disorders.",0.7328863739967346,0.8111639618873596,0.7562875151634216,"Cancer

1. **Genetics**: It is possible that people with a genetic predisposition may be more likely to develop CFS.
2. **Infections**: Certain viral or bacterial infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Ross River virus (RRV), rubella virus, Coxiella burnetii, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, may increase the risk of developing CFS, particularly if the infection is severe.
3. **Weakened immune system**: A weakened immune system may contribute to the development of CFS.
4. **Hormone imbalances**: Some people with CFS may have abnormal hormone levels, although it is unclear whether this is a contributing factor.
5. **Emotional stress**: Severe emotional stress, such as from physical or emotional trauma, may increase the risk of developing CFS.
6. **Problems with energy usage**: Some people with ME/CFS have problems converting their body's fuel (primarily fats and sugars) into energy.
7. **Interactions between conditions**: A combination of factors, such as infections and stress, may increase the risk of developing CFS.

It's essential to note that these potential causes are not yet confirmed and more research is needed to understand the underlying causes of CFS.",0.7922976613044739,0.6804593801498413,0.8663553595542908,Infections,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, three, B12, about 1, CDC, 10, Infections","two, many years","2, 3, CFS, Coxiella, Ross River, 1, 4, 6, RRV, Epstein-Barr, Mycoplasma, EBV, 7, 5, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome","2, 3, 4, 1, 7, 5, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome","2, 3, Coxiella, 4, Ross River, 1, 6, RRV, Mycoplasma, EBV, 7, 5, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome"
