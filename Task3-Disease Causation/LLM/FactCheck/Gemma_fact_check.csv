46,"**1. Genetic Mutations:**

* About 85% of hemophilia cases are due to mutations in specific genes encoding clotting factors (such as factor VIII and IX).
* These mutations can impair or eliminate the clotting function of these factors, leading to impaired clot formation.


**2. Chromosomal Abnormalities:**

* In about 15% of cases, hemophilia is caused by deletions or mutations in the X chromosome.
* Males are more commonly affected because they have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, and a mutation or deletion on the X chromosome can result in hemophilia.


**3. Acquired Hemophilia:**

* This is a rare type of hemophilia that develops after injury, surgery, or certain medical interventions.
* The underlying mechanism is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to immune-mediated damage to clotting factors.


**4. Postpartum Hemophilia:**

* A condition where bleeding episodes occur in newborn infants after birth.
* This is usually caused by deficiencies in clotting factors, which are not fully formed in the fetus at birth.


**5. Inherited Hemophilia A and B:**

* These are the two main types of hemophilia caused by mutations in clotting factor genes.
* Hemophilia A is caused by mutations in factor VIII, while hemophilia B is caused by mutations in factor IX.",0.7485688328742981,0.7938105463981628,0.6825406551361084,"8, Autoimmune, Cancer
