The exact causes of PsA are not fully understood, but several factors contribute to its development. Some of the main causes and risk factors include:\\n\\n1. **Genetic predisposition**: PsA often runs in families, suggesting a strong genetic component. People with a family history of psoriasis, arthritis, or PsA are more likely to develop the condition.\\n2. **Autoimmune response**: PsA is characterized by an abnormal immune response, where the body's immune system attacks healthy joints and skin cells. This leads to inflammation and damage.\\n3. **Abnormal cytokine production**: Cytokines are chemical signals that help regulate the immune response. In PsA, certain cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), are overproduced, contributing to inflammation and joint damage.\\n4. **Infection**: Some research suggests that certain infections, such as Lyme disease or Epstein-Barr virus, may trigger PsA in predisposed individuals.\\n5. **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal fluctuations, particularly in women, may contribute to the development of PsA.\\n6. **Environmental factors**: Exposure to certain environmental toxins, such as coal tar or styrene, has been linked to an increased risk of developing PsA.\\n7. **Obesity**: Being overweight or obese may increase the risk of developing PsA,\",\n          \"The main causes of tuberculosis (TB) include:\\n\\n1. **Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection**: This bacterium is the primary cause of TB. It is usually inhaled through the air, often when an individual is in close proximity to someone who is infected with TB.\\n\\n2. **Close contact with an infected person**: People who live or work in close proximity to someone with active TB are at a higher risk of developing the disease.\\n\\n3. **Poor ventilation in homes and workplaces**: Areas with poor airflow can increase the risk of transmission by allowing the bacteria to be inhaled more easily.\\n\\n4. **Weakened immune system**: Individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, are more susceptible to TB.\\n\\n5. **Poor nutrition and malnutrition**: Malnutrition can impair the immune system, making individuals more vulnerable to infections like TB.\\n\\n6. **Increased exposure to M. tuberculosis**: People who are exposed to second-hand smoke, have overcrowded living conditions, or have poor hygiene practices are more at risk of developing TB.\\n\\n7. **Age**: Older adults and newborns are more susceptible to TB, especially if they have weakened immune systems.\\n\\n8. **Climate and geography**: Certain regions, such as Africa and parts of Asia, have higher rates of TB due to factors like overcrowding, poor nutrition, and lack of access to healthcare.\\n\\nPrevention measures for TB include vaccination, proper hygiene practices, and avoidance of close contact with infected individuals when possible.\",\n          \"The exact causes of Parkinson's disease (PD) are still not fully understood, but research has identified several key factors that contribute to its development. Some of the main causes and risk factors include:\\n\\n1. **Genetic predisposition**: Mutations in genes such as SNCA, Parkin, and DJ-1 can increase the risk of developing PD.\\n2. **Brain aging**: As we age, the risk of developing PD increases. The brain's dopamine-producing neurons, which produce a neurotransmitter called dopamine, gradually die off, leading to motor symptoms.\\n3. **Neuroinflammation**: Chronic inflammation in the brain, which is often triggered by infections, injury, or environmental toxins, can lead to oxidative stress and damage to dopamine-producing neurons.\\n4. **Oxidative stress**: The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage dopamine-producing neurons, leading to cell death and the onset of PD symptoms.\\n5. **Neurodegeneration**: The progressive degeneration of dopaminergic nerve cells, which leads to the loss of dopamine production, is a hallmark of PD.\\n6. **Disruption of dopamine signaling**: Alterations in dopamine signaling can lead to motor symptoms, and disruptions in this signaling pathway are thought to play a role in the development of PD.\\n7. **Exposure to toxins**: Exposure to certain toxins, such as pesticides, heavy metals, and solvent exposure, may increase the risk of developing PD.\\n8. **Autoimmune responses**: Some research\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
