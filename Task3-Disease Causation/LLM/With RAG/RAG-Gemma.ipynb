These droplets can be inhaled by others, leading to infection.\\n* **Drug resistance:** Some strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have become resistant to the drugs used to treat TB. This can make the disease harder to cure and increase the risk of spread. \\n\\n\\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\",\n          \"Although the exact cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, the provided information highlights several key factors:\\n\\n**Primary Culprit:**\\n\\n* **Dopamine Depletion:**  The core issue is the progressive loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. This leads to irregular brain activity and the characteristic movement problems.\\n\\n**Contributing Factors:**\\n\\n* **Genetic Predisposition:** Certain genetic changes can increase the risk of Parkinson's, though these are often linked to familial cases.\\n* **Environmental Factors:** Exposure to toxins like MPTP (found in some illegal drugs), pesticides, and possibly well water may increase risk, but a definitive link is still being researched.\\n* **Lewy Bodies:** These protein clumps found in the brains of people with Parkinson's are believed to hold clues about the disease's cause, though their exact role is unclear.\\n* **Alpha-Synuclein:** This protein is a key component of Lewy bodies and its abnormal clumping is thought to be involved in cell damage.\\n\\n**Other Potential Influences:**\\n\\n* **Virus Triggers:** Some scientists speculate that viruses may play a role in triggering Parkinson's disease.\\n* **Mitochondrial Dysfunction:** Changes in mitochondria (the cell's energy producers) can contribute to cell damage.\\n* **Aging:** Parkinson's is most common after age 60.\\n* **Sex:** Men are more likely to develop the disease than women.\\n* **Race:**
