Certain genetic markers, such as changes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, have been identified as risk factors.\\n\\n2. **Environmental triggers:** Physical trauma, viral or bacterial infections, extreme stress, or injury may trigger psoriatic arthritis in people with an inherited tendency.\\n\\nWhile the exact cause of psoriatic arthritis is still unknown, a combination of genetic and environmental factors seems to play a role in triggering the disease.\",\n          \"According to the provided information, the main causes of tuberculosis (TB) are:\\n\\n1. **Inhaling Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria**: TB is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is spread through the air when someone with active TB disease coughs, sneezes, talks, or sings, releasing tiny droplets that carry the bacteria.\\n\\n2. **Poor treatment and misuse of antibiotics**: Drug-resistant strains of TB can develop when antibiotic drugs are not used correctly or fail to kill all the bacteria, leading to the establishment and multiplication of resistant bacteria.\\n\\n3. **Underlying health conditions**: Certain people are more likely to develop TB disease after being infected, including those with weakened immune systems (such as people with HIV), young children, older adults, people with other diseases like diabetes, and those who have not been treated correctly for TB in the past.\\n\\n4. **Living or working in crowded spaces**: The disease spreads more easily in crowded gatherings and in places where people live or work together for long periods, especially in countries or areas where TB is common.\\n\\nThese factors contribute to the spread of TB and the development of the disease in susceptible individuals.\",\n          \"According to the information provided, the main factors that seem to play a role in the development of Parkinson's disease are:\\n\\n1. **Genes**: Specific genetic changes are linked to Parkinson's disease, although they are rare unless many family members have had the disease.\\n2. **Environmental factors**: Exposure to certain toxins or other environmental factors may increase the risk of Parkinson's disease, such as:\\n\\t* MPTP (a substance found in some illegal drugs)\\n\\t* Pesticides\\n\\t* Contaminated well water used for drinking\\n3. **Unknown or unconfirmed factors**:\\n\\t* Viruses: Some scientists believe that viruses may trigger Parkinson's disease.\\n\\t* Head injuries\\n\\t* Geographic location (higher prevalence in white people compared to Black or Asian people)\\n4. **Altered cellular processes**:\\n\\t* Changes to mitochondria (powerhouse compartments inside cells that create most of the body's energy)\\n\\t* Presence of Lewy bodies (clumps of proteins in the brain associated with Parkinson's disease)\\n\\t* Abnormal alpha-synuclein protein found within Lewy bodies\\n\\nIt is essential to note that the exact cause of Parkinson's disease is still unknown, and researchers continue to study the various factors that contribute to the development of the disease.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n
